One day in the spring I saw an old man, sitting on a bench next to a lake in the forest. His foldable bike next to the bench, a binocular in his hands, he was watching birds.
The weeks went by and I saw him again and again. Our encounters started with a nod, then a short greeting, each time I passed by the bench. And one day he lifted his hand, signalizing me he would like to say something. I don’t remember what he wanted to talk about, maybe how nice the weather was or that he was happy it stopped raining.
Weeks passed and we greeted each other and sometimes we talked for a few minutes.

Before even jumping into the codebase, I recommend understanding the 'macros' aka the business behind the product you're going to be responsible for. No need to understand every single intricacies about the company, but at least information around these few points:
Understand the value the company is giving to its customers

This chapter will equip you with that plan of action. It covers how to integrate safety principles into your design work in order to create tech that’s safe, how to convince your stakeholders that this work is necessary, and how to respond to the critique that what we actually need is more diversity.

And then I started learning the poem. First for fun, and I wasn’t sure I would be able to remember it, because it’s long (10 stanzas with four lines). I was surprised and impressed when I was able to remember it after two weeks in its entirety.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
console.log() is a debugging tool that can assist you to figure out what your code is doing. You may follow along as your code executes by displaying a message that contains either descriptive text that tells you what's going on or the values of certain variables.
Removing all console.log() from your project before production can be very difficult, Here is how to remove all console.log() from your project in less than a minute. 
Step 1
Open your project in VS Code ( Since we are using Regex, It is easier to use it in VS Code )
Step 2
Click on the search icon on VS Code sidebar. It will open the search option

Step 3
In search placeholder type console.log.*$ and select Use Regex option which can be found on the upper right corner of the search panel that’s designated by the icon .*

Step 4
Once you searched for all the console.log(), Click on replace to remove all console.log()
and BOOM 💥 Now you don't have any console.log() in your project

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, JavaScript Developers👩‍💻
In this article we'll dig deeper into the concepts of Set and Map. 
What is a Set?
A Set is a collection of unique values. That means the set can never have any duplicates and can hold any values of any data type. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order.
Okay, this sounds interesting. So the question is how to create a set?
To create a set we write- new Set() and in the parentheses, we need to pass an iterable.
const ordersSet= new Set(['Pasta','Pizza','Coffee','Pasta','Pizza']);

console.log(ordersSet);  // {'Pasta', 'Pizza', 'Coffee'}

Here in the above example, we see some duplicate set elements like Pasta and Pizza. When we log in to the console we get a set that has a size of 3. 
You might think the elements were 5 before …]]></summary>

Step 1: Sign Up For An Account
Go to https://auth0.com/signup to create a free Auth0 account.

Tenant: represents the user domain that has access to the Auth0 application configurations, assets, connections, etc. The tenant domain name will be the URL used to access resources such as the Auth0 API.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction 📚
When you go to GitHub and see some other developers code, most of them are importing their components like this👇
import Button from "../../../components/Buttons/Button"

This is called relative import. Relative import will start with either ./,/ or ../.
I am not telling that this is the wrong way and even there is no issue if you import like that, but if you have a very big and complex project, relative imports will look a lot messy similar to this. 
import Button from "../../../../../../components/Buttons/Button"

However, there is a very better and cleaner way to import these components. This method is called absolute import. An absolute import will look this like 👇
import Button from "components/Buttons/Button"

Adding absolute imports to React Apps (CRA) 💡
Open your project in any code editor and create a new file in your project's root directory named jsconfig.json. Once you created the file paste the below JSON inside of it. 
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src"
  }
}

This will instruct Webpack to use the src directory as a base one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome back to GraphQL for Beginners! A beginner-friendly series introducing the basic concepts of GraphQL and how to connect it to a front-end framework like React using Apollo. 
In this part, we will complete our simple chat app by building our front-end with React and Apollo Client. 
If you haven't read the previous part, please read it here.
Step 1: Create a React App
To recap, our project folder currently has a server folder in it. Let's create a client folder now for our React app.
In our client folder, we can create a new React app:
npx create-react-app my-app

Now, your project folder should look something like this:

Step 2: Install packages
To connect our React app to our GraphQL server, we need to install a few packages:

In this article, we’ll learn about the optional chaining (?.) that simplifies the way to access values through nested objects.
What the heck is Optional chaining?  🥴
The optional chaining ?.  is a recent addition to the language which is a secure way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn’t exist. 
With the optional chaining if a certain property doesn't exist then undefined is returned immediately.
The optional chaining ?. syntax has three forms:
obj?.prop – returns obj.prop if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj?.[prop] – returns obj[prop] if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj.method?.() – calls obj.method() if obj.method exists, otherwise returns undefined

This guide is aimed at both designers who want to learn about accessibility considerations for designing focus indicators, as well as developers who want to implement them.
