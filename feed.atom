And one day he lifted his hand, signalizing me he would like to say something. I don’t remember what he wanted to talk about, maybe how nice the weather was or that he was happy it stopped raining.

1. Understand the Business
Before even jumping into the codebase, I recommend understanding the 'macros' aka the business behind the product you're going to be responsible for. No need to understand every single intricacies about the company, but at least information around these few points:
Understand the value the company is giving to its customers
Know what software are currently in development (and which one you're likely to be working on)
Know the business context of the app, the purpose it serves for the compa…]]></summary>

The intention to make our tech safer is not enough; we need a strategy.
This chapter will equip you with that plan of action. It covers how to integrate safety principles into your design work in order to create tech that’s safe, how to convince your stakeholders that this work is necessary, and how to respond to the critique that what we actually need is more diversity. (Spoiler: we do, but diversity alone is not the antidote to fixing unethical, unsafe tech.)

And then I started learning the poem. First for fun, and I wasn’t sure I would be able to remember it, because it’s long (10 stanzas with four lines). I was surprised and impressed when I was able to remember it after two weeks in its entirety.

console.log() is a debugging tool that can assist you to figure out what your code is doing. You may follow along as your code executes by displaying a message that contains either descriptive text that tells you what's going on or the values of certain variables.
Removing all console.log() from your project before production can be very difficult, Here is how to remove all console.log() from your project in less than a minute. 
Step 1
Open your project in VS Code ( Since we are using Regex, It is easier to use it in VS Code )
Step 2
Click on the search icon on VS Code sidebar. It will open the search option

Step 3
In search placeholder type console.log.*$ and select Use Regex option which can be found on the upper right corner of the search panel that’s designated by the icon .*

Step 4
Once you searched for all the console.log(), Click on replace to remove all console.log()
and BOOM 💥 Now you don't have any console.log() in your project

In this article we'll dig deeper into the concepts of Set and Map. 
What is a Set?
A Set is a collection of unique values. That means the set can never have any duplicates and can hold any values of any data type. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order.
Okay, this sounds interesting. So the question is how to create a set?
To create a set we write- new Set() and in the parentheses, we need to pass an iterable.
const ordersSet= new Set(['Pasta','Pizza','Coffee','Pasta','Pizza']);

console.log(ordersSet);  // {'Pasta', 'Pizza', 'Coffee'}

Here in the above example, we see some duplicate set elements like Pasta and Pizza. When we log in to the console we get a set that has a size of 3. 
You might think the elements were 5 before …]]></summary>

To put it frankly, Google has become one of the most widely utilized online resources for discovering everything from random facts and music videos to products and services.
The sophisticated Google search methods and tips listed below can help you narrow your search results.
1. Site:
Using site: will search within a specific website. For example, if you want to find an article that is published only on Hackernoon, you can simply type 
site:hackernoon.com article_keyword


2. Asterisk *
You can use * to fill missing words or phrases, like :
How to integrate * in nodejs


3. Quotation " "
"" is used to search for words or phrases, like :
"Why facebook created react"


4. Related:
You can use related: to sites that are similar to other sites, for example
related:netflix.com


5. link:
Use link: to find a page that links to another page, like :

You can use the pwd command to find out your current location in the filesystem/name of the folder currently open in your terminal window. 
The output of pwd will look something like this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction 📚
When you go to GitHub and see some other developers code, most of them are importing their components like this👇
import Button from "../../../components/Buttons/Button"

This is called relative import. Relative import will start with either ./,/ or ../.
I am not telling that this is the wrong way and even there is no issue if you import like that, but if you have a very big and complex project, relative imports will look a lot messy similar to this. 
import Button from "../../../../../../components/Buttons/Button"

However, there is a very better and cleaner way to import these components. This method is called absolute import. An absolute import will look this like 👇
import Button from "components/Buttons/Button"

Adding absolute imports to React Apps (CRA) 💡
Open your project in any code editor and create a new file in your project's root directory named jsconfig.json. Once you created the file paste the below JSON inside of it. 
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src"
  }
}

This will instruct Webpack to use the src directory as a base one.

In our client folder, we can create a new React app:

In this article, we’ll learn about the optional chaining (?.) that simplifies the way to access values through nested objects.
What the heck is Optional chaining?  🥴
The optional chaining ?.  is a recent addition to the language which is a secure way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn’t exist. 
With the optional chaining if a certain property doesn't exist then undefined is returned immediately.
The optional chaining ?. syntax has three forms:
obj?.prop – returns obj.prop if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj?.[prop] – returns obj[prop] if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj.method?.() – calls obj.method() if obj.method exists, otherwise returns undefined
To understand the concept better let's have a look at a few of the use cases.…]]></summary>
