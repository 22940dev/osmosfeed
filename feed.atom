Ways to contribute to a project


Before continuing further, let's talk about a common misconception. Many developers have the misconception that contributing to open source is all about programming. 
Thankfully, that is false, and there are many other ways to contribute to open-source. Some of the ways you can contribute are as follows:

The weeks went by and I saw him again and again. Our encounters started with a nod, then a short greeting, each time I passed by the bench. And one day he lifted his hand, signalizing me he would like to say something. I don’t remember what he wanted to talk about, maybe how nice the weather was or that he was happy it stopped raining.

The poem is an echo from 100 years ago. Full of wisdom and a mirror held up to our generation. It’s deep and not easy to understand which was the reason I dug into it. I wrote a modern interpretation of the poem a few month ago.
And then I started learning the poem. First for fun, and I wasn’t sure I would be able to remember it, because it’s long (10 stanzas with four lines). I was surprised and impressed when I was able to remember it after two weeks in its entirety.

console.log() is a debugging tool that can assist you to figure out what your code is doing. You may follow along as your code executes by displaying a message that contains either descriptive text that tells you what's going on or the values of certain variables.
Removing all console.log() from your project before production can be very difficult, Here is how to remove all console.log() from your project in less than a minute. 
Step 1
Open your project in VS Code ( Since we are using Regex, It is easier to use it in VS Code )
Step 2
Click on the search icon on VS Code sidebar. It will open the search option

Step 3
In search placeholder type console.log.*$ and select Use Regex option which can be found on the upper right corner of the search panel that’s designated by the icon .*

and BOOM 💥 Now you don't have any console.log() in your project

In this article we'll dig deeper into the concepts of Set and Map. 
What is a Set?
A Set is a collection of unique values. That means the set can never have any duplicates and can hold any values of any data type. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order.
Okay, this sounds interesting. So the question is how to create a set?
To create a set we write- new Set() and in the parentheses, we need to pass an iterable.
const ordersSet= new Set(['Pasta','Pizza','Coffee','Pasta','Pizza']);

console.log(ordersSet);  // {'Pasta', 'Pizza', 'Coffee'}

Here in the above example, we see some duplicate set elements like Pasta and Pizza. When we log in to the console we get a set that has a size of 3. 
You might think the elements were 5 before …]]></summary>

Today, we're going to take a look at some basic Mac Terminal/Linux commands in my experience. 
So, don't roast me friends😅  I'm a n00b at this stuff, so I haven't used shit like cat, grep, pbcopy or pbpaste yet.

Without further ado, let's get fuckin started!!

1. pwd 🗺📍 
You can use the pwd command to find out your current location in the filesystem/name of the folder currently open in your terminal window. 
The output of pwd will look something like this:

After executing the pwd command, the terminal tells us that we're in the folder called Yuri inside of the folder Users at root.
2. ls 📝 
The ls command is used to list all the folders/files under the location specified, or if not specified, under the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction 📚
When you go to GitHub and see some other developers code, most of them are importing their components like this👇
import Button from "../../../components/Buttons/Button"

This is called relative import. Relative import will start with either ./,/ or ../.
I am not telling that this is the wrong way and even there is no issue if you import like that, but if you have a very big and complex project, relative imports will look a lot messy similar to this. 
import Button from "../../../../../../components/Buttons/Button"

However, there is a very better and cleaner way to import these components. This method is called absolute import. An absolute import will look this like 👇
import Button from "components/Buttons/Button"

Adding absolute imports to React Apps (CRA) 💡
Open your project in any code editor and create a new file in your project's root directory named jsconfig.json. Once you created the file paste the below JSON inside of it. 
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src"
  }
}

This will instruct Webpack to use the src directory as a base one.
Conclusion ⌛

Step 1: Create a React App
To recap, our project folder currently has a server folder in it. Let's create a client folder now for our React app.
In our client folder, we can create a new React app:

Now, your project folder should look something like this:

In this article, we’ll learn about the optional chaining (?.) that simplifies the way to access values through nested objects.
What the heck is Optional chaining?  🥴
The optional chaining ?.  is a recent addition to the language which is a secure way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn’t exist. 
With the optional chaining if a certain property doesn't exist then undefined is returned immediately.
The optional chaining ?. syntax has three forms:
obj?.prop – returns obj.prop if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj?.[prop] – returns obj[prop] if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj.method?.() – calls obj.method() if obj.method exists, otherwise returns undefined
To understand the concept better let's have a look at a few of the use cases.…]]></summary>

What's an API?
Let's start by refreshing our memory on what an API is. The acronym API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it's a way for two computer programs to communicate between them.
In simple terms, it's a piece of software offering its services to other programs through a pre-defined set of functions. The other programs do not need to know about the API implementation because the functions describe how the API can be used. You communicate with APIs through requests, and there are four types of requests…]]></summary>

I came across something I added many months ago - using the Fetch API to upload multiple files at once. The reason it's stuck in my "todo" pile for so long is that I wasn't aware of a good service I could use to post my files against. I've done it before in Node.js and I know it's something I could do locally in an hour, but honestly I just didn't want to. That probably sounds a bit lazy but it's honest. Today though I came across httpbin.org, an online service that lets you hit it with various types of HTTP methods and even supports file uploads. (Obviously it doesn't make those files available, it just reports back on the upload.) Even better, it supports CORS which means I could use CodePen. So with no more excuses at my disposal, today I finally built a simple demo.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, you can include HTML inside of HTML, just like a react / angular component. In this short article, I am going to walk you through, how to include HTML inside of HTML. 
Creating files
Go ahead and create a new HTML file and add the following simple code inside of it
<!-- index.html -->

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Include HTML inside of HTML</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

now create a new file and name it nav.html ( You can name it anything since this will be the component that we will include in index.html). Once created you can either write your component or paste this simple navbar code
<!-- nav.html -->

But on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England—conditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting—and yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes. 
This shift in the benchmark had profound effects; the world now knew that the four-minute mile was possible. Bannister’s record lasted only forty-six days, when it was snatched away by Australian ru…]]></summary>
