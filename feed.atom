And then I started learning the poem. First for fun, and I wasn’t sure I would be able to remember it, because it’s long (10 stanzas with four lines). I was surprised and impressed when I was able to remember it after two weeks in its entirety.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
console.log() is a debugging tool that can assist you to figure out what your code is doing. You may follow along as your code executes by displaying a message that contains either descriptive text that tells you what's going on or the values of certain variables.
Removing all console.log() from your project before production can be very difficult, Here is how to remove all console.log() from your project in less than a minute. 
Step 1
Open your project in VS Code ( Since we are using Regex, It is easier to use it in VS Code )
Step 2
Click on the search icon on VS Code sidebar. It will open the search option

Step 3
In search placeholder type console.log.*$ and select Use Regex option which can be found on the upper right corner of the search panel that’s designated by the icon .*

Step 4
Once you searched for all the console.log(), Click on replace to remove all console.log()
and BOOM 💥 Now you don't have any console.log() in your project
Conclusion ⌛

In this article we'll dig deeper into the concepts of Set and Map. 
What is a Set?
A Set is a collection of unique values. That means the set can never have any duplicates and can hold any values of any data type. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order.
Okay, this sounds interesting. So the question is how to create a set?
To create a set we write- new Set() and in the parentheses, we need to pass an iterable.
const ordersSet= new Set(['Pasta','Pizza','Coffee','Pasta','Pizza']);

console.log(ordersSet);  // {'Pasta', 'Pizza', 'Coffee'}

Here in the above example, we see some duplicate set elements like Pasta and Pizza. When we log in to the console we get a set that has a size of 3. 
You might think the elements were 5 before …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google is such a dominant force in the search engine industry that it is the default search engine for Android smartphones and web browsers such as Chrome. To put it frankly, Google has become one of the most widely utilized online resources for discovering everything from random facts and music videos to products and services.
The sophisticated Google search methods and tips listed below can help you narrow your search results.
1. Site:
Using site: will search within a specific website. For example, if you want to find an article that is published only on Hackernoon, you can simply type 
site:hackernoon.com article_keyword


2. Asterisk *
You can use * to fill missing words or phrases, like :
How to integrate * in nodejs


3. Quotation " "
"" is used to search for words or phrases, like :
"Why facebook created react"


4. Related:
You can use related: to sites that are similar to other sites, for example
related:netflix.com


5. link:
Use link: to find a page that links to another page, like : 
link:suhailkakar.com

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction 📚
When you go to GitHub and see some other developers code, most of them are importing their components like this👇
import Button from "../../../components/Buttons/Button"

This is called relative import. Relative import will start with either ./,/ or ../.
I am not telling that this is the wrong way and even there is no issue if you import like that, but if you have a very big and complex project, relative imports will look a lot messy similar to this. 
import Button from "../../../../../../components/Buttons/Button"

However, there is a very better and cleaner way to import these components. This method is called absolute import. An absolute import will look this like 👇
import Button from "components/Buttons/Button"

Adding absolute imports to React Apps (CRA) 💡
Open your project in any code editor and create a new file in your project's root directory named jsconfig.json. Once you created the file paste the below JSON inside of it. 
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src"
  }
}

This will instruct Webpack to use the src directory as a base one.

In this part, we will complete our simple chat app by building our front-end with React and Apollo Client. 
If you haven't read the previous part, please read it here.
Step 1: Create a React App
To recap, our project folder currently has a server folder in it. Let's create a client folder now for our React app.
In our client folder, we can create a new React app:
npx create-react-app my-app

Now, your project folder should look something like this:

Step 2: Install packages

In this article, we’ll learn about the optional chaining (?.) that simplifies the way to access values through nested objects.
What the heck is Optional chaining?  🥴
The optional chaining ?.  is a recent addition to the language which is a secure way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn’t exist. 
With the optional chaining if a certain property doesn't exist then undefined is returned immediately.
The optional chaining ?. syntax has three forms:
obj?.prop – returns obj.prop if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj?.[prop] – returns obj[prop] if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj.method?.() – calls obj.method() if obj.method exists, otherwise returns undefined
To understand the concept better let's have a look at a few of the use cases.…]]></summary>

What's an API?
Let's start by refreshing our memory on what an API is. The acronym API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it's a way for two computer programs to communicate between them.
In simple terms, it's a piece of software offering its services to other programs through a pre-defined set of functions. The other programs do not need to know about the API implementation because the functions describe how the API can be used. You communicate with APIs through requests, and there are four types of requests…]]></summary>

I came across something I added many months ago - using the Fetch API to upload multiple files at once. The reason it's stuck in my "todo" pile for so long is that I wasn't aware of a good service I could use to post my files against. I've done it before in Node.js and I know it's something I could do locally in an hour, but honestly I just didn't want to. That probably sounds a bit lazy but it's honest. Today though I came across httpbin.org, an online service that lets you hit it with various types of HTTP methods and even supports file uploads. (Obviously it doesn't make those files available, it just reports back on the upload.) Even better, it supports CORS which means I could use CodePen. So with no more excuses at my disposal, today I finally built a simple demo.]]></summary>

Runners had been attempting it since the late 19th century and were beginning to draw the conclusion that the human body simply wasn’t built for the task. 
But on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England—conditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting—and yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes. 
This shift in the benchmark had profound effects; the world now knew that the four-minute mile was possible. Bannister’s record lasted only forty-six days, when it was snatched away by Australian ru…]]></summary>

Subscriptions
In Part 1, we learnt about the 2 operations GraphQL supports: queries and mutations. The third type is known as subscriptions. 
Subscriptions are the operation used to push data from the server to the client on a specified event. Like queries, they fetch data and return it, but only when a certain change happens. Thus, subscriptions work by having an active connection to your GraphQL server (i.e. via WebSocket), where it will listen for a …]]></summary>

However, many people are put off by the complexity of the projects. They also think that contributing to open-source is all about coding.
But that is not true! You can contribute to open source projects in other ways, such as:
Writing documentation
Creating supporting materials
Reviewing code
Translating to other languages
Structure and re-structure the code and project structure
Thus, in this article, you will learn how to make your first open-source contributions with the help of Hashnode documentation. Hashnode is a blogging platform that open-sourced their documentation, which is a great place to start your open-source journey.

Whether to convey information, conduct transactions, or simply to check in on one another, people have yammered away, chattering and gesticulating, through spoken conversation for countless generations. Only in the last few millennia have we begun to commit our conversations to writing, and only in the last few decades have we begun to outsource them to the computer, a machine that shows much more affinity for written correspondence than for the slangy vagaries of spoken language.
Computers have trouble because between spoken and written language, speech is more primordial. To have successful conversations with us, machines must grapple with the messiness of human speech: the disfluencies and pauses, the gestures and body language, an…]]></summary>

JavaScript is a scripting language for building dynamic web pages. It adhered to client-side development principles, thus it operates entirely within the user's web browser and requires no resources from the web server. Javascript may also be used with other technologies such as REST APIs, XML, and others.
Typescript is a superset of Javascript. It is a statically built language for writing Javascript code that is straightforward and simple. It may be used with Node.js or any browser that supports ECMAScript 3 or above. 
Difference Between Javascript and Typescript

Don't do this to anyone with ill intent, this is a legit hacking tool part of the hacking process called osens, where we gather information about our hacking targets. What we're doing is not technically illegal we're just gathering publicly available information on the internet but the lines can blur based on your intentions so just be careful use this as a learning tool.
Introduction
Sherlock is a powerful command line tool supplied by the Sherlock Project that may be used to locate usernames across a variety of social media platforms. It is a python open-source project available at GitHub. You just need to input the username and Sherlock will return all the social media account url of that username
Requirement
This best thing about this project is that you don't need any extra thing, You just need a web browser
How To Use ?
Open this  link  in your browser. This will open Google Cloud Console which we can use its shell to install Sherlock
Make sure to check the Trust checkbox and click on Confirm and wait for 10 seconds 

Once everything is done, go a head and paste the below code in the Cloud Shell 
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

If all the packages are installed successfully, you should see something similar to below picture

Now we can start using Sherlock, you just need to a username to get the social media account. In the Cloud Shell paste the below code and click enter ( change username with the account you want to get information, In my case suhailkakar) and will get all the social media profile of the username
python3 sherlock --timeout 1 username

Fish (the “friendly interactive shell”) has the explicit goal of being more user-friendly than other shells. It features a modern command-line interface with syntax highlighting, tab completion, and auto-suggestions out of the box (all with no configuration required). Unlike many of its competitors, it doesn’t care about being POSIX-compliant but attempts to blaze its own path.
Since our last look at the project, way back in 2013, it has seen lots of new releases with features, bug fixes, and refinements aimed at appealing to a wide range of users.]]></summary>
