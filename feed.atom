console.log() is a debugging tool that can assist you to figure out what your code is doing. You may follow along as your code executes by displaying a message that contains either descriptive text that tells you what's going on or the values of certain variables.
Removing all console.log() from your project before production can be very difficult, Here is how to remove all console.log() from your project in less than a minute. 
Step 1
Open your project in VS Code ( Since we are using Regex, It is easier to use it in VS Code )
Step 2
Click on the search icon on VS Code sidebar. It will open the search option

Step 3
In search placeholder type console.log.*$ and select Use Regex option which can be found on the upper right corner of the search panel that’s designated by the icon .*

Step 4
Once you searched for all the console.log(), Click on replace to remove all console.log()
and BOOM 💥 Now you don't have any console.log() in your project

In this article we'll dig deeper into the concepts of Set and Map. 
What is a Set?
A Set is a collection of unique values. That means the set can never have any duplicates and can hold any values of any data type. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order.
Okay, this sounds interesting. So the question is how to create a set?
To create a set we write- new Set() and in the parentheses, we need to pass an iterable.
const ordersSet= new Set(['Pasta','Pizza','Coffee','Pasta','Pizza']);

console.log(ordersSet);  // {'Pasta', 'Pizza', 'Coffee'}

Here in the above example, we see some duplicate set elements like Pasta and Pizza. When we log in to the console we get a set that has a size of 3. 
You might think the elements were 5 before …]]></summary>

To put it frankly, Google has become one of the most widely utilized online resources for discovering everything from random facts and music videos to products and services.
The sophisticated Google search methods and tips listed below can help you narrow your search results.
1. Site:
Using site: will search within a specific website. For example, if you want to find an article that is published only on Hackernoon, you can simply type 
site:hackernoon.com article_keyword


2. Asterisk *
You can use * to fill missing words or phrases, like :
How to integrate * in nodejs


3. Quotation " "
"" is used to search for words or phrases, like :
"Why facebook created react"


4. Related:
You can use related: to sites that are similar to other sites, for example
related:netflix.com


5. link:
Use link: to find a page that links to another page, like :

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction 📚
When you go to GitHub and see some other developers code, most of them are importing their components like this👇
import Button from "../../../components/Buttons/Button"

This is called relative import. Relative import will start with either ./,/ or ../.
I am not telling that this is the wrong way and even there is no issue if you import like that, but if you have a very big and complex project, relative imports will look a lot messy similar to this. 
import Button from "../../../../../../components/Buttons/Button"

However, there is a very better and cleaner way to import these components. This method is called absolute import. An absolute import will look this like 👇
import Button from "components/Buttons/Button"

Adding absolute imports to React Apps (CRA) 💡
Open your project in any code editor and create a new file in your project's root directory named jsconfig.json. Once you created the file paste the below JSON inside of it. 
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src"
  }
}

This will instruct Webpack to use the src directory as a base one.

In this article, we’ll learn about the optional chaining (?.) that simplifies the way to access values through nested objects.
What the heck is Optional chaining?  🥴
The optional chaining ?.  is a recent addition to the language which is a secure way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn’t exist. 
With the optional chaining if a certain property doesn't exist then undefined is returned immediately.
The optional chaining ?. syntax has three forms:
obj?.prop – returns obj.prop if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj?.[prop] – returns obj[prop] if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj.method?.() – calls obj.method() if obj.method exists, otherwise returns undefined
To understand the concept better let's have a look at a few of the use cases.…]]></summary>

As you can see, I received  11,109 visitors in DEV, 15,149 visitors in Hashnode, and 2,817 in Devdojo which is a total of 29,075. And the strategies that I used are
1. Publishing articles consistently
I published a new blog article every day ( or at least 1 article per two days ) and I've never gone more than a week without blogging.

Thus, in this article, you will see how to do that! First, you will create an API from scratch, and then you will sell it on RapidAPI!
What's an API?
Let's start by refreshing our memory on what an API is. The acronym API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it's a way for two computer programs to communicate between them.
In simple terms, it's a piece of software offering its services to other programs through a pre-defined set of functions. The other programs do not need to know about the API implementation because the functions describe how the API can be used. You communicate with APIs through requests, and there are four types of requests…]]></summary>

I came across something I added many months ago - using the Fetch API to upload multiple files at once. The reason it's stuck in my "todo" pile for so long is that I wasn't aware of a good service I could use to post my files against. I've done it before in Node.js and I know it's something I could do locally in an hour, but honestly I just didn't want to. That probably sounds a bit lazy but it's honest. Today though I came across httpbin.org, an online service that lets you hit it with various types of HTTP methods and even supports file uploads. (Obviously it doesn't make those files available, it just reports back on the upload.) Even better, it supports CORS which means I could use CodePen. So with no more excuses at my disposal, today I finally built a simple demo.]]></summary>

But on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England—conditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting—and yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes.

Node.js is an open-source, JavaScript runtime environment on Chrome’s V8 that lets you effortlessly develop fast and scalable web applications. It utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight, efficient, and excellent for data-intensive real-time applications that run across shared devices.
Twilio Verify is a comprehensive solution for validating end-user phone numbers, which will be used to deliver a numeric code to the Android / iOS app through text message. Our server app will sit in between our app and Verify, allowing us to verify a user's phone number once they sign up for your mobile app.

As movement toward memory-safe languages, and Rust in particular, continues to grow, it is worth looking at one of the larger scale efforts to port C code that has existed for decades to Rust. The uutils project aims to rewrite all of the individual utilities included in the GNU Coreutils project in Rust. Originally created by Jordi Boggiano in 2013, the project aims to provide drop-in replacements for the Coreutils programs, adding the data-race protection and memory safety that Rust provides.]]></summary>

A beginner-friendly series introducing the basic concepts of GraphQL and how to connect it to a front-end framework like React using Apollo. At the end of this series, you will be able to build a simple chat app with GraphQL, React and Apollo.
Sneak Peek:

Subscriptions
In Part 1, we learnt about the 2 operations GraphQL supports: queries and mutations. The third type is known as subscriptions. 
Subscriptions are the operation used to push data from the server to the client on a specified event. Like queries, they fetch data and return it, but only when a certain change happens.
