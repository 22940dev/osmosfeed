I came across something I added many months ago - using the Fetch API to upload multiple files at once. The reason it's stuck in my "todo" pile for so long is that I wasn't aware of a good service I could use to post my files against. I've done it before in Node.js and I know it's something I could do locally in an hour, but honestly I just didn't want to. That probably sounds a bit lazy but it's honest. Today though I came across httpbin.org, an online service that lets you hit it with various types of HTTP methods and even supports file uploads. (Obviously it doesn't make those files available, it just reports back on the upload.) Even better, it supports CORS which means I could use CodePen. So with no more excuses at my disposal, today I finally built a simple demo.]]></summary>

But on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England—conditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting—and yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes. 
This shift in the benchmark had profound effects; the world now knew that the four-minute mile was possible. Bannister’s record lasted only forty-six days, when it was snatched away by Australian ru…]]></summary>

Thus, subscriptions work by having an active connection to your GraphQL server (i.e. via WebSocket), where it will listen for a …]]></summary>

Don't do this to anyone with ill intent, this is a legit hacking tool part of the hacking process called osens, where we gather information about our hacking targets. What we're doing is not technically illegal we're just gathering publicly available information on the internet but the lines can blur based on your intentions so just be careful use this as a learning tool.
Introduction
Sherlock is a powerful command line tool supplied by the Sherlock Project that may be used to locate usernames across a variety of social media platforms. It is a python open-source project available at GitHub. You just need to input the username and Sherlock will return all the social media account url of that username
Requirement
This best thing about this project is that you don't need any extra thing, You just need a web browser
How To Use ?
Open this  link  in your browser. This will open Google Cloud Console which we can use its shell to install Sherlock
Make sure to check the Trust checkbox and click on Confirm and wait for 10 seconds 

Once everything is done, go a head and paste the below code in the Cloud Shell 
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

If all the packages are installed successfully, you should see something similar to below picture

Now we can start using Sherlock, you just need to a username to get the social media account. In the Cloud Shell paste the below code and click enter ( change username with the account you want to get information, In my case suhailkakar) and will get all the social media profile of the username
python3 sherlock --timeout 1 username

Fish (the “friendly interactive shell”) has the explicit goal of being more user-friendly than other shells.

Unlike many of its competitors, it doesn’t care about being POSIX-compliant but attempts to blaze its own path.
Since our last look at the project, way back in 2013, it has seen lots of new releases with features, bug fixes, and refinements aimed at appealing to a wide range of users.]]></summary>

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database for storing large amounts of data. MongoDB uses collections and documents instead of tables and rows, as in traditional relational databases. MongoDB is a database that first appeared in the mid-2000s.
The NoSQL database is a replacement for traditional SQL databases, and it includes almost all of the functionality found in RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) systems. Due to its simple architecture, support for both horizontal and vertical scalability, and easy and simple control over the data, NoSQL databases have grown considerably more popular in recent years than in the past.

The mobile version has mobile-only settings, to customize the toolbar and quick action.

Synchronization
To sync between Desktop and mobile devices the Obsidian vaults have to be moved in an iCloud system folder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was a big fan of Windows OS, and have been using it for years because it is user-friendly, well-designed, and convenient. However, since I started programming I found that a Linux distro (such as Ubuntu, Manjaro, and Arch) is the best Operating System to start with.
In this article, I am going to share, why I most of the software engineers choose Linux over Windows for programming
Pre-installed Compilers
The primary reason behind the popularity of Linux is the availability of compilers or interpreter. You don't have to download them yourself. On the other hand, Windows does not come with pre-installed compilers.
Open Source
Unlike Windows OS which is commercial, Linux is an open source software that is freely available to download. There are hundreds of Linux distributions available out of which almost five-hundred distro are in active development.
Community Support
All newcomers can find help on any of the Linux forums. If you are stuck somewhere in your development process or need help in your coding process, just Google it and you can find several Linux based helpful resources.
Performance
Linux is much powerful and versatile than Windows. It is light-weight OS, which makes it faster than Windows. You will notice a significant improvement in speed on a Linux distro when you start working it.
Secure
Linux is considered to be more secure than Windows. No antivirus is needed. Since it is open source, several developers are working on it and everyone can contribute code. It is likely that someone will find a vulnerability long before hackers can target a Linux distro. 
Shell
If Linux does not have what you need, you can still get all the functionalities that you need from the command line. Simply enter the command and it will atomically download and install the package. Which saves a lot of efforts.]]></summary>

🔥 Day 1 🔥
This is the first TTT we're having so it'll be a simple one🔥
What will console output below? 
let sum = function(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}

console.log(sum(3, 2));


🚨🚨🚨 ANSWER BELOW 🚨🚨🚨
The code will return the number 5 and undefined. This is because the code didn't explicitly return any value! 
It first logs (a + b), then it calls the function, which will return undefined:
let sum = function(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
    //no return;
} 

console.log(sum(3, 2)); //returns 5 and undefined

What is Firebase
Firebase is a Backend as a Service that started as a YC11 startup and grew up into a next-generation app-development platform on Google Cloud Platform. Firebase frees developers to focus crafting fantastic user experiences. You don’t need to manage servers. You don’t need to write APIs. Firebase is your server, your API and your datastore, all written so generically that you can modify it to suit most needs. Yeah, you’ll occasionally need to use other bits of the Google Cloud for your advanced applications. Firebase can’t be everything to everybody. But it gets pretty close.
