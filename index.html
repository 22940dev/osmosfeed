                    <span>Hello and welcome to Part 4 of the GitHub Actions series. A series where we will walk through everything you need to know about GitHub Actions, from the basics to creating your own customized workflow.
In this previous part, we learned about secrets, how to use actions from different sources and pass arguments using with. We also created a simple automate pull request review workflow after putting together all that we have learned.
If you have missed it, please read Part 3 here.
This part of the series will be an exciting one. We will develop a CI/CD workflow to automate linting, testing and deploying an app using GitHub Actions. Without further ado, let&#x27;s begin!
Step 1: Plan a CI/CD Workflow
Before we start building the workflow, we need to plan what to include in our CI/CD workflow.

                    <span>Something I miss from my old blog-ware was the ability to define blog post relationships. While editing a post, I could easily select posts I wanted to create a connection with. When the blog post was rendered, these related entries were shown at the end in a consistent manner. These relationships were bidirectional so if post A linked to C, when rendering C I&#x27;d render a link to A as a related post. I was curious how this could be done with Eleventy.</span>

                    <span>Do you remember when having a great website was enough? Now, people are getting answers from Siri, Google search snippets, and mobile apps, not just our websites. Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an omnichannel content strategy, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.
But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model—a definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people and systems understand content—with my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer’s omnichannel content strategy. You can avoid that outcome by creating content models that are semantic and that also connect related content.…</span>

                    <span>Hello and welcome to Part 3 of the GitHub Actions series. A series where we will walk through everything you need to know about GitHub Actions, from the basics to creating your own customized workflow.
In this previous part, we learned about Environment Variables and how they can be used in a workflow. A reader then asked about secrets so let me quickly follow-up the great question in this part, then move onto actions.
If you have missed Part 2, please read it here.
Secrets
Secrets are encrypted environment variables. It allows you to use sensitive information   for your workflow. You can create secrets for a repository, organization on environment.
Once a secret is created and stored, it cannot be viewed or edited. To change a secret, you would need to delete it and create a new one with …</span>

Here are the finest programming projects to boost your confidence and make you a better developer, whether you&#x27;re a novice or returning to coding. I&#x27;ve also mentioned the technologies that can be used in each project, but feel free to use any of your favorite programming languages or frameworks.

We&#x27;ve got a very active set of forums but I know that most developers tend to use StackOverflow for all their support needs. At the time I joined, we didn&#x27;t really have tags that were being used consistently, so myself and others figured out what tag names were going to use, updated some older questions to use the right tags, and even seeded a few questions ourselves.

                    <span>There’s been a recent discussion on Twitter about the idea of adding a new element in HTML that represents a search interface. A search form, basically.
The idea is to create a semantic HTML element for the ARIA search role, which represents a landmark region “that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a search facility.”
Opinions have been shared in the Twitter thread about whether adding a new HTML element is necessary. Many have argued that it was unnecessary because we can use the ARIA search role and repurpose a form element to create the same semantics. I disagree. And this article is the longer version of my personal opinion on the subject.

                    <span>For web developers, a personal portfolio page is like a resume. Instead of listing your skills on a resume in the traditional way, you can prove your competence with a personal portfolio.
When people or potential employers see your portfolio, they can get a glimpse of your skills. Thus, online portfolios are a great way to showcase your work and skills.
However, creating an online portfolio is not straightforward for everyone. For example, you might struggle with questions such as:
What should I add to my portfolio?
How should I structure it?
What technologies should I use to build it?

                    <span>I recently rediscovered Readwise again. I’ve heard of the service before, but couldn’t see the immediate advantage for me and had forgotten it again.
But when I heard a beta version of a Readwise plugin for Obsidian was released I started my 30 days testing period for Readwise. And it changed the way I write notes.
I read a lot: books, articles, or tweets and use Feedly (my RSS reader), Pocket, and Instapaper to highlight interesting sentences or paragraphs. I highlight on my Kindle, in Pocket, Feedly, PDF, and in Markdown files which made it confusing to find a highlight again later.
I highlight too much to extract everything into my Zettelkasten, but I would have loved to be able to search my highlights later. Searching in Feedly and Pocket is possible with a premium account but not comf…</span>

                    <span>Deploying an application created with a framework like React, Vue, or Angular differs significantly from deploying a website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Choosing a hosting provider for your app is very important, as your website performance depends on it. Here are some popular and free hosting services, that you can use to deploy your react app. 
Netlify
It&#x27;s the one I utilize for the majority of my projects. Netlify is a fantastic web development tool that is designed to help you increase your productivity as much as possible. Developers can use the platform to create, test, and deploy websites. Netlify is an incredibly rapid solution to assure that websites and apps are considerably more performant, scalable, and secure.

In this article, we are going to integrate Upload Care ( An Advanced File Uploader ) which includes drag-and-drop image uploader, direct link image uploader and etc.. in our react.js app. 
Creating a react app
The first step is to create a simple react app which you can do just by running the command below in your terminal. 
npx create-react-app upload-care

This might take a while and it depends on your computer specs but once it is done go to the new directory which is created ( In our case upload-care ) and run npm start or yarn start. This command will start the development server for your react app. Now open this directory (In our case upload-care) in any code editor
Cleaning up the project

                    <span>Hello and welcome to Part 2 of the GitHub Actions series. A series where we will walk through everything you need to know about GitHub Actions, from the basics to creating your own customized workflow.
If you have missed Part 1, please read it here before proceeding to Part 2.
In this part, let&#x27;s dive deeper into some attributes and useful things you need to know to customize a good workflow.
Job dependencies
Recap: Each workflow must have 1 job, each job has a unique identifier, they run in parallel by default.
As discussed in the previous part of this series, jobs are executed in parallel by default. In the example below, job1 and job2 will be run simultaneously.
jobs:
   job1: # unique identifier
      # job stuff here

   job2: # unique identifier

                    <span>People always think they wouldn’t have taken part in the unjust and evil deeds of totalitarian rule. But most of them are wrong, the Corona crisis proved this to me. Most people either cheer for unjust and evil or stay silent. Only a few see the creeping loss of freedom, one step at a time until it is a hundred little steps.
You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow […] But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. […] If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes millions would have been sufficiently shocked […] But of course, this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next.

                    <span>People always think they wouldn’t have taken part in the unjust and evil deeds of totalitarian rule. But most of them are wrong, the Corona crisis proved this to me. Most people either cheer for unjust and evil or stay silent. Only a few see the creeping loss of freedom, one step at a time until it is a hundred little steps.
You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow […] But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. […] If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes millions would have been sufficiently shocked […] But of course, this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next.

Thus, in this article, I want to discuss how I received the role and what it&#x27;s like to be a Developer Advocate.
Why am I writing this article


First of all, I received the job by putting my work online and by networking. Thus, I want to show the power of social media. Secondly, many people asked me about what it&#x27;s like to work as a Developer Advocate. So, I want to share my experience with them.
