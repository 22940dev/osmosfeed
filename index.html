In this part, we will start building a GraphQL server for a simple chat app with React and Apollo Client.

Setting up GraphQL Server
First, we need a GraphQL server to receive and send queries to our client.
To recap about GraphQL servers, feel free to read Part 2 of the series.
Step 1: Initialize project
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, install it here.

                    <span>In the 1950s, many in the elite running community had begun to believe it wasn’t possible to run a mile in less than four minutes. Runners had been attempting it since the late 19th century and were beginning to draw the conclusion that the human body simply wasn’t built for the task. 
But on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England—conditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting—and yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes. 
This shift in the benchmark had profound effects; the world now knew that the four-minute mile was possible. Bannister’s record lasted only forty-six days, when it was snatched away by Australian ru…</span>

Therefore in this article, I am going to teach you how to integrate Auth0 with React JS ( A popular JavaScript frontend library). 
Creating a react app
The first step is to create a simple react app which you can do just by running the command below in your terminal.

This might take a while and it depends on your computer specs but once it is done go to the new directory which is created ( In our case react-auth0 ) and run npm start or yarn start. This command will start the d…</span>

About the conference (what, when, where)
Access All Areas (or aaa) is a new online conference—part of a series of focussed conferences created by the folks at Web Directions. This conference is focussed on accessibility for developers: understanding the different kinds of accessibility issues that our code may create, finding those issues using available auditing and testing tools, as well as techniques and technologies for addressing them.
This inclusive, remote-friendly conference will take place for the first time this year …</span>

YouTube is a free video-sharing website that makes watching video clips easy. You may even make your own videos and post them to enjoy with others. YouTube, which was founded in 2005, is currently one of the most popular apps on the Internet, with over 6 billion hours of video watched each month.
React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. It’s based on React, Facebook’s JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms.

As movement toward memory-safe languages, and Rust in particular, continues to grow, it is worth looking at one of the larger scale efforts to port C code that has existed for decades to Rust. The uutils project aims to rewrite all of the individual utilities included in the GNU Coreutils project in Rust. Originally created by Jordi Boggiano in 2013, the project aims to provide drop-in replacements for the Coreutils programs, adding the data-race protection and memory safety that Rust provides.</span>

Subscriptions
In Part 1, we learnt about the 2 operations GraphQL supports: queries and mutations. The third type is known as subscriptions. 
Subscriptions are the operation used to push data from the server to the client on a specified event. Like queries, they fetch data and return it, but only when a certain change happens. Thus, subscriptions work by having an active connection to your GraphQL server (i.e. via WebSocket), where it will listen for a …</span>

I just got back from a much delayed honeymoon with my wife (apparently right before the mask mandates all come crashing back) and haven&#x27;t written code for a while so perhaps I was a bit desperate to create something useless.

You&#x27;re probably here because you&#x27;re confused about this arguments object shit. 
I don&#x27;t blame you, this shit was confusing for me too😅 I spent like days  trying to understand it. 

BUT don&#x27;t freak out!! My confusion is exactly why I&#x27;m writing a blog post. Easy version. For dummies like me to understand.
So don&#x27;t worry, I got you 😆

                    <span>We’ve been having conversations for thousands of years. Whether to convey information, conduct transactions, or simply to check in on one another, people have yammered away, chattering and gesticulating, through spoken conversation for countless generations. Only in the last few millennia have we begun to commit our conversations to writing, and only in the last few decades have we begun to outsource them to the computer, a machine that shows much more affinity for written correspondence than for the slangy vagaries of spoken language.
Computers have trouble because between spoken and written language, speech is more primordial. To have successful conversations with us, machines must grapple with the messiness of human speech: the disfluencies and pauses, the gestures and body language, an…</span>

                    <span>Introduction
JavaScript is a scripting language for building dynamic web pages. It adhered to client-side development principles, thus it operates entirely within the user&#x27;s web browser and requires no resources from the web server. Javascript may also be used with other technologies such as REST APIs, XML, and others.
Typescript is a superset of Javascript. It is a statically built language for writing Javascript code that is straightforward and simple. It may be used with Node.js or any browser that supports ECMAScript 3 or above. 
Difference Between Javascript and Typescript

To make the code comprehensible for browsers, it will convert to JavaScript code.

                    <span>Contributing to open-source is a great way to improve your programming skills, help others and learn how to work in a collaborative environment.
However, many people are put off by the complexity of the projects. They also think that contributing to open-source is all about coding.
But that is not true! You can contribute to open source projects in other ways, such as:
Writing documentation
Creating supporting materials
Reviewing code
Translating to other languages
Structure and re-structure the code and project structure
Thus, in this article, you will learn how to make your first open-source contributions with the help of Hashnode documentation. Hashnode is a blogging platform that open-sourced their documentation, which is a great place to start your open-source journey.

Introduction
Every developer&#x27;s job entails some kind of product design. It&#x27;s not just about having a good appearance; it&#x27;s also about having engaging visuals and a good overall presentation. Rather of spending time and money on a lengthy design process, it is preferable to leverage resources that offer ready-to-use components and features for a fantastic, amazing, and outstanding product.

Don&#x27;t do this to anyone with ill intent, this is a legit hacking tool part of the hacking process called osens, where we gather information about our hacking targets. What we&#x27;re doing is not technically illegal we&#x27;re just gathering publicly available information on the internet but the lines can blur based on your intentions so just be careful use this as a learning tool.
Introduction
Sherlock is a powerful command line tool supplied by the Sherlock Project that may be used to locate usernames across a variety of social media platforms. It is a python open-source project available at GitHub. You just need to input the username and Sherlock will return all the social media account url of that username
Requirement
This best thing about this project is that you don&#x27;t need any extra thing, You just need a web browser
How To Use ?
Open this  link  in your browser. This will open Google Cloud Console which we can use its shell to install Sherlock
Make sure to check the Trust checkbox and click on Confirm and wait for 10 seconds 

Once everything is done, go a head and paste the below code in the Cloud Shell 
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

If all the packages are installed successfully, you should see something similar to below picture

Now we can start using Sherlock, you just need to a username to get the social media account. In the Cloud Shell paste the below code and click enter ( change username with the account you want to get information, In my case suhailkakar) and will get all the social media profile of the username
python3 sherlock --timeout 1 username

1. Freelancing
For many developers, freelancing is profitable source of income.  Some people take it as a full-time job, while others do it as a part-time job to earn additional cash. Some platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and many more offer a great opportunity for anyone to start freelancing, but there is a lot of competition there, so be sure to stand out among them 

2. Sell an Ebook
Writing an ebook is one of those things that may pay off for a long time. You can write a highly useful ebook as a developer that covers a certain topic of software development. Alternatively, you may opt to describe a programming language in such a way that your readers will have a better understanding of it.
Writing books is also a won…</span>

Fish (the “friendly interactive shell”) has the explicit goal of being more user-friendly than other shells. It features a modern command-line interface with syntax highlighting, tab completion, and auto-suggestions out of the box (all with no configuration required). Unlike many of its competitors, it doesn’t care about being POSIX-compliant but attempts to blaze its own path.
Since our last look at the project, way back in 2013, it has seen lots of new releases with features, bug fixes, and refinements aimed at appealing to a wide range of users.</span>

                    <span>What is MongoDB
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database for storing large amounts of data. MongoDB uses collections and documents instead of tables and rows, as in traditional relational databases. MongoDB is a database that first appeared in the mid-2000s.
The NoSQL database is a replacement for traditional SQL databases, and it includes almost all of the functionality found in RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) systems. Due to its simple architecture, support for both horizontal and vertical scalability, and easy and simple control over the data, NoSQL databases have grown considerably more popular in recent years than in the past.
It allows programmers to store data in the database according to their program&#x27;s real requirements. We can&#x27;t get this kind of functionality …</span>

                    <span>Do you know what&#x27;s the best way to learn any programming language?
The answer is quite simple and obvious: by building lots of projects  💪
Learning Web Development can be challenging. But as programmers, we always strive for better ways to be more effective and productive.
What is Project-Based Learning?
-According to Robert Schuetz,
 Project-Based Learning is an instructional approach designed to allow students to develop knowledge and skills through engaging projects set around challenges and problems they may face in the real world.
Tutorials are great, but building projects is the best way to learn. Bridge the gap between theory and real-world code by working on projects.
In this article, we&#x27;ll come across a number of projects ranging from -&gt; ( Beginner to advanced level ) for you.

                    <span>JavaScript is a programming language used primarily by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript.
While JavaScript is not the only client-side scripting language on the Internet, it was one of the first and it is still the most widely used. Many developers believe that JavaScript is inefficient and finicky, so they have made many improvements to the language over the years.
Here are the 21 JavaScript tricks that makes you a JavaScript pro

                    <span>With the release of the mobile versions of Obsidian last week, my note-taking workflow got even more comfortable.
The mobile versions are fantastic. They support all plugins of the Desktop version, even community plugins.
A few of the plugins do make not a lot of sense, though (like Sliding Panes on a mobile phone) and I hope a future version brings the option to turn off specific extensions just on mobile.
The mobile version has mobile-only settings, to customize the toolbar and quick action.

Synchronization
To sync between Desktop and mobile devices the Obsidian vaults have to be moved in an iCloud system folder.
The synchronization is super fast (I assume thanks to Apple CloudKit). It takes 2-3 seconds to see a change reflected live on another device.

                    <span>I was a big fan of Windows OS, and have been using it for years because it is user-friendly, well-designed, and convenient. However, since I started programming I found that a Linux distro (such as Ubuntu, Manjaro, and Arch) is the best Operating System to start with.
In this article, I am going to share, why I most of the software engineers choose Linux over Windows for programming
Pre-installed Compilers
The primary reason behind the popularity of Linux is the availability of compilers or interpreter. You don&#x27;t have to download them yourself. On the other hand, Windows does not come with pre-installed compilers.
Open Source
Unlike Windows OS which is commercial, Linux is an open source software that is freely available to download. There are hundreds of Linux distributions available out of which almost five-hundred distro are in active development.
Community Support
All newcomers can find help on any of the Linux forums. If you are stuck somewhere in your development process or need help in your coding process, just Google it and you can find several Linux based helpful resources.
Performance
Linux is much powerful and versatile than Windows. It is light-weight OS, which makes it faster than Windows. You will notice a significant improvement in speed on a Linux distro when you start working it.
Secure
Linux is considered to be more secure than Windows. No antivirus is needed. Since it is open source, several developers are working on it and everyone can contribute code. It is likely that someone will find a vulnerability long before hackers can target a Linux distro. 
Shell
If Linux does not have what you need, you can still get all the functionalities that you need from the command line. Simply enter the command and it will atomically download and install the package. Which saves a lot of efforts.</span>

                    <span>Welcome once again to my blog! 
If you know anything about CSS, you probably know that CSS units are confusing AF...
em?? rem??😰
Can&#x27;t we just use px?
ch????? What the HELL is this? 🤯

Today we&#x27;re going to briefly learn about CSS units, since they&#x27;re so freaking confusing!
In this blog post, I&#x27;ll do my best to briefly explain each unit, and its best usage.
Contents
px   
%
em
rem
vw/vh
ch
🐝 px (absolute) 
Best usage: small details, for example, border size or shadow
Ah....yes. Everyone&#x27;s first CSS unit 😆
We&#x27;re all guilty of using px for every single thing at the beginning of our learning journeys...💀

Hopefully, now we know that px is probably not the best unit to use.
But we&#x27;ll go over it pretty quick, since it&#x27;s still very common.

                    <span>According to Statista, React Native is the most popular technologies for cross-platform software development of mobile applications for two years in a row.
Releasing an app on both App Store and Google Play is every business’s desire. But the trick is, before shipping a mobile app to the market, you have to choose a technology stack. Is it going to be React Native, Flutter or some other technologies ?
What is React Native and Why you should use it ?
React Native is a popular open-source library that runs on JavaScript.It is written with the combination of XML -Esque markup and JavaScript which is also known as JSX. React Native primarily focuses on the native rendering of applications that is majorly compatible with Android and iOS.
Pros of React Native
Large developer community

These are programming trivia questions I&#x27;ve hosted on Twitter every day. You don’t have to code at all, they&#x27;re just little warm-up exercises to stimulate y&#x27;all brains 🤓 🧠
The reason I&#x27;m doing this on Twitter is not to start fights in the comments, but so that other developers (including me) can learn from each others&#x27; answers and logic! 
It&#x27;s a great way to help others and to contribute to the community, while still learning!
The idea here is to help each other better understand, and maybe to learn a new thing every day. This is not a competition to see who is the smartest!
BE NICE!

This is the first TTT we&#x27;re having so it&#x27;ll be a simple one🔥
What will console output below? 
let sum &#x3D; function(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}

console.log(sum(3, 2));


🚨🚨🚨 ANSWER BELOW 🚨🚨🚨
The code will return the number 5 and undefined. This is because the code didn&#x27;t explicitly return any value! 
It first logs (a + b), then it calls the function, which will return undefined:
let sum &#x3D; function(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
    //no return;
} 

console.log(sum(3, 2)); //returns 5 and undefined

What is Firebase
Firebase is a Backend as a Service that started as a YC11 startup and grew up into a next-generation app-development platform on Google Cloud Platform. Firebase frees developers to focus crafting fantastic user experiences. You don’t need to manage servers. You don’t need to write APIs. Firebase is your server, your API and your datastore, all written so generically that you can modify it to suit most needs. Yeah, you’ll occasionally need to use other bits of the Google Cloud for your advanced applications. Firebase can’t be everything to everybody. But it gets pretty close.
Getting Started

Being self-taught, I decided to make a Twitter account to help people with their self-taught journey. I was hitting a very rough patch on my own learning; I was having difficulties understanding certain programming concepts, and found tutorials to be very difficult (especially docs). I wanted to help beginners like me t…</span>

                    <span>Being developers, we work with many different languages. Which makes it humanly impossible to remember all its aspects. Yes, we do have MDN docs, but looking at them for every little issue can be time-consuming. This is when a &quot;Cheat Sheet&quot; comes super-handy.
In this post, we&#x27;ll go through some quick and useful cheat sheets that&#x27;ll save you hours in wasted time each week.
When it comes to Web development, HTML is the first choice. Web development generally comprises 3 fundamentals: basically HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.
 HTML Cheat Sheet
Looking for a cheat sheet that contains useful code examples and web developer tools, markup generators, and more? Well, you’re going to love this.

                    <span>In this article, I want to share my experience of using GitHub Copilot for a week. My first impressions, some demonstration of how it works, and my current impressions of the product.
First Impression
It was July 8. I was excited to receive an email in the morning, that I finally got access to Copilot. I immediately went to install it in the Visual Studio Marketplace. What I first noticed when I arrived there was that Copilot had a 3-star average rating. I investigated further and was shocked to see the reason behind these mediocre reviews:

Most poor (1-2 star) reviews are emotionally driven and do not contain any constructive feedback. A simple sentimental analysis shows that most bad reviews were mostly showing apprehension, concern and disagreement before even really testing the produc…</span>

Flash, Photoshop, and responsive design
When I first started designing websites, my go-to software was Photoshop. I created a 960px canvas and set about creating a layout that I would later drop content in. The development phase was about attaining pixel-perfect accuracy using fixed widths, fixed heights, and absolute positioning.
Ethan Marcotte’s talk at An Event Apart and subsequent article “Responsive Web Design” in A List Apart in 2010 changed all this. I was sold on responsive design as soon as I heard about it, but I was also terrified. The pixel-perfect designs f…</span>

This all came about from me doing some research on an Eleventy tagged question on StackOverflow. If you aren&#x27;t aware, Liquid has a tag built in called capture. It looks like so:</span>

There are 7,950,000,000+ mobile users around to world, and If you want to make your business successful, you should have mobile app beside your website.
React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. It’s based on React, Facebook’s JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms.
