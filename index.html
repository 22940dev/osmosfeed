                    <span>Hey Readers üëã
In this article, we‚Äôll learn about the optional chaining (?.) that simplifies the way to access values through nested objects.
What the heck is Optional chaining?  ü•¥
The optional chaining ?.  is a recent addition to the language which is a secure way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn‚Äôt exist. 
With the optional chaining if a certain property doesn&#x27;t exist then undefined is returned immediately.
The optional chaining ?. syntax has three forms:
obj?.prop ‚Äì returns obj.prop if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj?.[prop] ‚Äì returns obj[prop] if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj.method?.() ‚Äì calls obj.method() if obj.method exists, otherwise returns undefined
To understand the concept better let&#x27;s have a look at a few of the use cases.‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Welcome back to GraphQL for Beginners! A beginner-friendly series introducing the basic concepts of GraphQL and how to connect it to a front-end framework like React using Apollo. 
In this part, we will complete our simple chat app by building our front-end with React and Apollo Client. 
If you haven&#x27;t read the previous part, please read it here.
Step 1: Create a React App
To recap, our project folder currently has a server folder in it. Let&#x27;s create a client folder now for our React app.
In our client folder, we can create a new React app:
npx create-react-app my-app

Now, your project folder should look something like this:

Step 2: Install packages
To connect our React app to our GraphQL server, we need to install a few packages:

This guide is aimed at both designers who want to learn about accessibility considerations for designing focus indicators, as well as developers who want to implement them.

The other programs do not need to know about the API implementation because the functions describe how the API can be used.

                    <span>JavaScript is a programming language used primarily by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript. While JavaScript is not the only client-side scripting language on the Internet, it was one of the first and it is still the most widely used.

                    <span>This afternoon I was going through my &quot;blog ideas&quot; list and cleaning up entries I&#x27;ve changed my mind on. I came across something I added many months ago - using the Fetch API to upload multiple files at once. The reason it&#x27;s stuck in my &quot;todo&quot; pile for so long is that I wasn&#x27;t aware of a good service I could use to post my files against. I&#x27;ve done it before in Node.js and I know it&#x27;s something I could do locally in an hour, but honestly I just didn&#x27;t want to. That probably sounds a bit lazy but it&#x27;s honest. Today though I came across httpbin.org, an online service that lets you hit it with various types of HTTP methods and even supports file uploads. (Obviously it doesn&#x27;t make those files available, it just reports back on the upload.) Even better, it supports CORS which means I could use CodePen. So with no more excuses at my disposal, today I finally built a simple demo.</span>

Creating files
Go ahead and create a new HTML file and add the following simple code inside of it




    
    
    
    Include HTML inside of HTML






now create a new file and name it nav.html ( You can name it anything since this will be the component that we will include in index.html). Once created you can either write your component or paste this simple navbar code

In this part, we will start building a GraphQL server for a simple chat app with React and Apollo Client. 
Sneak Peek:

If you haven&#x27;t read the previous part, please read it here.
Setting up GraphQL Server
First, we need a GraphQL server to receive and send queries to our client.
To recap about GraphQL servers, feel free to read Part 2 of the series.
Step 1: Initialize project
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, install it here.
Then, create a new project with the following commands in the terminal:
mkdir project   // create project folder

Runners had been attempting it since the late 19th century and were beginning to draw the conclusion that the human body simply wasn‚Äôt built for the task.¬†
But on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England‚Äîconditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting‚Äîand yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes.¬†
This shift in the benchmark had profound effects; the world now knew that the four-minute mile was possible. Bannister‚Äôs record lasted only forty-six days, when it was snatched away by Australian ru‚Ä¶</span>

Therefore in this article, I am going to teach you how to integrate Auth0 with React JS ( A popular JavaScript frontend library). 
Creating a react app
The first step is to create a simple react app which you can do just by running the command below in your terminal. 
npx create-react-app react-auth0

This might take a while and it depends on your computer specs but once it is done go to the new directory which is created ( In our case react-auth0 ) and run npm start or yarn start. This command will start the d‚Ä¶</span>

Twilio Verify is a comprehensive solution for validating end-user phone numbers, which will be used to deliver a numeric code to the Android / iOS app through text message. Our server app will sit in between our app and Verify, allowing us to verify a user&#x27;s phone number once they sign up for your mobile app.

YouTube is a free video-sharing website that makes watching video clips easy. You may even make your own videos and post them to enjoy with others. YouTube, which was founded in 2005, is currently one of the most popular apps on the Internet, with over 6 billion hours of video watched each month.
React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. It‚Äôs based on React, Facebook‚Äôs JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms.

As movement toward memory-safe languages, and Rust in particular, continues to grow, it is worth looking at one of the larger scale efforts to port C code that has existed for decades to Rust. The uutils project aims to rewrite all of the individual utilities included in the GNU Coreutils project in Rust. Originally created by Jordi Boggiano in 2013, the project aims to provide drop-in replacements for the Coreutils programs, adding the data-race protection and memory safety that Rust provides.</span>

                    <span>Welcome back to GraphQL for Beginners! A beginner-friendly series introducing the basic concepts of GraphQL and how to connect it to a front-end framework like React using Apollo. At the end of this series, you will be able to build a simple chat app with GraphQL, React and Apollo.
Sneak Peek:

If you haven&#x27;t read Part 1, please do so here.
Subscriptions
In Part 1, we learnt about the 2 operations GraphQL supports: queries and mutations. The third type is known as subscriptions. 
Subscriptions are the operation used to push data from the server to the client on a specified event. Like queries, they fetch data and return it, but only when a certain change happens. Thus, subscriptions work by having an active connection to your GraphQL server (i.e. via WebSocket), where it will listen for a ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Let me begin by being very clear. This is not a very good idea. I just got back from a much delayed honeymoon with my wife (apparently right before the mask mandates all come crashing back) and haven&#x27;t written code for a while so perhaps I was a bit desperate to create something useless. That being said, working on this did let me kick the tires a bit on a few Eleventy things and that&#x27;s always a good idea.</span>

Computers have trouble because between spoken and written language, speech is more primordial. To have successful conversations with us, machines must grapple with the messiness of human speech: the disfluencies and pauses, the gestures and body language, an‚Ä¶</span>

JavaScript is a scripting language for building dynamic web pages. It adhered to client-side development principles, thus it operates entirely within the user&#x27;s web browser and requires no resources from the web server. Javascript may also be used with other technologies such as REST APIs, XML, and others.
Typescript is a superset of Javascript. It is a statically built language for writing Javascript code that is straightforward and simple. It may be used with Node.js or any browser that supports ECMAScript 3 or above. 
Difference Between Javascript and Typescript

To make the code comprehensible for browsers, it will convert to JavaScript code.

                    <span>Contributing to open-source is a great way to improve your programming skills, help others and learn how to work in a collaborative environment.
However, many people are put off by the complexity of the projects. They also think that contributing to open-source is all about coding.
But that is not true! You can contribute to open source projects in other ways, such as:
Writing documentation
Creating supporting materials
Reviewing code
Translating to other languages
Structure and re-structure the code and project structure
Thus, in this article, you will learn how to make your first open-source contributions with the help of Hashnode documentation. Hashnode is a blogging platform that open-sourced their documentation, which is a great place to start your open-source journey.

Don&#x27;t do this to anyone with ill intent, this is a legit hacking tool part of the hacking process called osens, where we gather information about our hacking targets. What we&#x27;re doing is not technically illegal we&#x27;re just gathering publicly available information on the internet but the lines can blur based on your intentions so just be careful use this as a learning tool.
Introduction
Sherlock is a powerful command line tool supplied by the Sherlock Project that may be used to locate usernames across a variety of social media platforms. It is a python open-source project available at GitHub. You just need to input the username and Sherlock will return all the social media account url of that username
Requirement
This best thing about this project is that you don&#x27;t need any extra thing, You just need a web browser
How To Use ?
Open this  link  in your browser. This will open Google Cloud Console which we can use its shell to install Sherlock
Make sure to check the Trust checkbox and click on Confirm and wait for 10 seconds 

Once everything is done, go a head and paste the below code in the Cloud Shell 
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

If all the packages are installed successfully, you should see something similar to below picture

Now we can start using Sherlock, you just need to a username to get the social media account. In the Cloud Shell paste the below code and click enter ( change username with the account you want to get information, In my case suhailkakar) and will get all the social media profile of the username
python3 sherlock --timeout 1 username

1. Freelancing
For many developers, freelancing is profitable source of income.  Some people take it as a full-time job, while others do it as a part-time job to earn additional cash. Some platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and many more offer a great opportunity for anyone to start freelancing, but there is a lot of competition there, so be sure to stand out among them 

2. Sell an Ebook
Writing an ebook is one of those things that may pay off for a long time. You can write a highly useful ebook as a developer that covers a certain topic of software development. Alternatively, you may opt to describe a programming language in such a way that your readers will have a better understanding of it.

Fish (the ‚Äúfriendly interactive shell‚Äù) has the explicit goal of being more user-friendly than other shells. It features a modern command-line interface with syntax highlighting, tab completion, and auto-suggestions out of the box (all with no configuration required). Unlike many of its competitors, it doesn‚Äôt care about being POSIX-compliant but attempts to blaze its own path.
Since our last look at the project, way back in 2013, it has seen lots of new releases with features, bug fixes, and refinements aimed at appealing to a wide range of users.</span>

                    <span>What is MongoDB
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database for storing large amounts of data. MongoDB uses collections and documents instead of tables and rows, as in traditional relational databases. MongoDB is a database that first appeared in the mid-2000s.
The NoSQL database is a replacement for traditional SQL databases, and it includes almost all of the functionality found in RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) systems. Due to its simple architecture, support for both horizontal and vertical scalability, and easy and simple control over the data, NoSQL databases have grown considerably more popular in recent years than in the past.
It allows programmers to store data in the database according to their program&#x27;s real requirements. We can&#x27;t get this kind of functionality ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Do you know what&#x27;s the best way to learn any programming language?
The answer is quite simple and obvious: by building lots of projects  üí™
Learning Web Development can be challenging. But as programmers, we always strive for better ways to be more effective and productive.
What is Project-Based Learning?
-According to Robert Schuetz,
 Project-Based Learning is an instructional approach designed to allow students to develop knowledge and skills through engaging projects set around challenges and problems they may face in the real world.
Tutorials are great, but building projects is the best way to learn. Bridge the gap between theory and real-world code by working on projects.
In this article, we&#x27;ll come across a number of projects ranging from -&gt; ( Beginner to advanced level ) for you.

                    <span>JavaScript is a programming language used primarily by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript.
While JavaScript is not the only client-side scripting language on the Internet, it was one of the first and it is still the most widely used. Many developers believe that JavaScript is inefficient and finicky, so they have made many improvements to the language over the years.
Here are the 21 JavaScript tricks that makes you a JavaScript pro

At the end of this series, you will have a simple chat app built with GraphQL, React and Apollo.
Sneak Peek:

Prerequisites
No prior knowledge in GraphQL and Apollo needed
Any code editor
Intermediate-beginner experience with React, JavaScript
For Windows: Git and Git Bash installed
Optional: Get GraphQL in VS Code extension for syntax highlighting

Introduction to GraphQL
Before we even start building the app, we need to learn the technologies we will be using. In particular, GraphQL.

The mobile versions are fantastic. They support all plugins of the Desktop version, even community plugins.
A few of the plugins do make not a lot of sense, though (like Sliding Panes on a mobile phone) and I hope a future version brings the option to turn off specific extensions just on mobile.
The mobile version has mobile-only settings, to customize the toolbar and quick action.

Synchronization
To sync between Desktop and mobile devices the Obsidian vaults have to be moved in an iCloud system folder.
The synchronization is super fast (I assume thanks to Apple CloudKit). It takes 2-3 seconds to see a change reflected live on another device.

                    <span>I was a big fan of Windows OS, and have been using it for years because it is user-friendly, well-designed, and convenient. However, since I started programming I found that a Linux distro (such as Ubuntu, Manjaro, and Arch) is the best Operating System to start with.
In this article, I am going to share, why I most of the software engineers choose Linux over Windows for programming
Pre-installed Compilers
The primary reason behind the popularity of Linux is the availability of compilers or interpreter. You don&#x27;t have to download them yourself. On the other hand, Windows does not come with pre-installed compilers.
Open Source
Unlike Windows OS which is commercial, Linux is an open source software that is freely available to download. There are hundreds of Linux distributions available out of which almost five-hundred distro are in active development.
Community Support
All newcomers can find help on any of the Linux forums. If you are stuck somewhere in your development process or need help in your coding process, just Google it and you can find several Linux based helpful resources.
Performance
Linux is much powerful and versatile than Windows. It is light-weight OS, which makes it faster than Windows. You will notice a significant improvement in speed on a Linux distro when you start working it.
Secure
Linux is considered to be more secure than Windows. No antivirus is needed. Since it is open source, several developers are working on it and everyone can contribute code. It is likely that someone will find a vulnerability long before hackers can target a Linux distro. 
Shell
If Linux does not have what you need, you can still get all the functionalities that you need from the command line. Simply enter the command and it will atomically download and install the package. Which saves a lot of efforts.</span>

Ah....yes. Everyone&#x27;s first CSS unit üòÜ
We&#x27;re all guilty of using px for every single thing at the beginning of our learning journeys...üíÄ

Hopefully, now we know that px is probably not the best unit to use.
But we&#x27;ll go over it pretty quick, since it&#x27;s still very common.

Releasing an app on both App Store and Google Play is every business‚Äôs desire. But the trick is, before shipping a mobile app to the market, you have to choose a technology stack. Is it going to be React Native, Flutter or some other technologies ?
What is React Native and Why you should use it ?
React Native is a popular open-source library that runs on JavaScript.It is written with the combination of XML -Esque markup and JavaScript which is also known as JSX. React Native primarily focuses on the native rendering of applications that is majorly compatible with Android and iOS.
Pros of React Native
Large developer community
Simplified UI
Fast Applications

                    <span>Welcome to ‚≠êÔ∏è Tech Trivia Time ‚≠êÔ∏è

These are programming trivia questions I&#x27;ve hosted on Twitter every day. You don‚Äôt have to code at all, they&#x27;re just little warm-up exercises to stimulate y&#x27;all brains ü§ì üß†
The reason I&#x27;m doing this on Twitter is not to start fights in the comments, but so that other developers (including me) can learn from each others&#x27; answers and logic! 
It&#x27;s a great way to help others and to contribute to the community, while still learning!
The idea here is to help each other better understand, and maybe to learn a new thing every day. This is not a competition to see who is the smartest!
BE NICE!

Tech Trivia question
Answer/explanation
üî• Day 1 üî•
This is the first TTT we&#x27;re having so it&#x27;ll be a simple oneüî•
What will console output below? 
let sum &#x3D; function(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}

console.log(sum(3, 2));


üö®üö®üö® ANSWER BELOW üö®üö®üö®
The code will return the number 5 and undefined. This is because the code didn&#x27;t explicitly return any value! 
It first logs (a + b), then it calls the function, which will return undefined:
let sum &#x3D; function(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
    //no return;
} 

console.log(sum(3, 2)); //returns 5 and undefined

What is Firebase
Firebase is a Backend as a Service that started as a YC11 startup and grew up into a next-generation app-development platform on Google Cloud Platform. Firebase frees developers to focus crafting fantastic user experiences. You don‚Äôt need to manage servers. You don‚Äôt need to write APIs. Firebase is your server, your API and your datastore, all written so generically that you can modify it to suit most needs. Yeah, you‚Äôll occasionally need to use other bits of the Google Cloud for your advanced applications. Firebase can‚Äôt be everything to everybody. But it gets pretty close.

üíõ How I started 
Being self-taught, I decided to make a Twitter account to help people with their self-taught journey. I was hitting a very rough patch on my own learning; I was having difficulties understanding certain programming concepts, and found tutorials to be very difficult (especially docs).
