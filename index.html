                    <span>Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level programming language for creating smart contracts on the blockchain that automate transactions. The language was created by participants to the Ethereum project when it was proposed in 2014. This language is mostly used to make smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
According to its documentation, &quot;Solidity is a curly-bracket language. It is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript, and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).&quot;
Solidity is also considered a dialect of JavaScript. This implies that if you know JavaScript, learning Solidity should be simple. Before learning more about solidity let&#x27;s understand some basic terms of blockchain.

In this previous part, we have built a complete CI/CD workflow by incorporating everything we have learned from Part 1 to Part 3.
If you have missed any parts, be sure to follow along from the top by checking out the series here.
In this final part of the series, let&#x27;s build our own custom action and deploy it to use in a workflow.

                    <span>Before I begin, a few quick notes. Yes, that title is intentional and not a typo. Honest. Secondly, like most of my dumb ideas, I think there&#x27;s some nuggets of interesting info in here, so I&#x27;ll do my best to highlight those important bits while minimizing the dumb idea. (Which I enjoyed building no matter how dumb it was and that&#x27;s the important part. ;) Lastly, this post will include some images that are randomized. I am fairly confident that no image will be inappropriate. If you see something bad though please let me know.</span>

Over the last few years, the World Wide Web has developed, bringing with it new tools and strategies. Web 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 are typical names for these stages. Now let&#x27;s understand each of their stags.

The primary goal of the websites was to make the information available to the general public. As servers were improved, average connection speeds rose, and developers gaine…</span>

                    <span>Hello and welcome to Part 4 of the GitHub Actions series. A series where we will walk through everything you need to know about GitHub Actions, from the basics to creating your own customized workflow.
In this previous part, we learned about secrets, how to use actions from different sources and pass arguments using with. We also created a simple automate pull request review workflow after putting together all that we have learned.
If you have missed it, please read Part 3 here.
This part of the series will be an exciting one. We will develop a CI/CD workflow to automate linting, testing and deploying an app using GitHub Actions. Without further ado, let&#x27;s begin!
Step 1: Plan a CI/CD Workflow
Before we start building the workflow, we need to plan what to include in our CI/CD workflow.

While editing a post, I could easily select posts I wanted to create a connection with. When the blog post was rendered, these related entries were shown at the end in a consistent manner. These relationships were bidirectional so if post A linked to C, when rendering C I&#x27;d render a link to A as a related post. I was curious how this could be done with Eleventy.</span>

                    <span>Do you remember when having a great website was enough? Now, people are getting answers from Siri, Google search snippets, and mobile apps, not just our websites.

Secrets
Secrets are encrypted environment variables. It allows you to use sensitive information   for your workflow. You can create secrets for a repository, organization on environment.

                    <span>One of the first things I did when I joined my new team at Adobe was to look at how, if at all, we were making use of StackOverflow. We&#x27;ve got a very active set of forums but I know that most developers tend to use StackOverflow for all their support needs. At the time I joined, we didn&#x27;t really have tags that were being used consistently, so myself and others figured out what tag names were going to use, updated some older questions to use the right tags, and even seeded a few questions ourselves. (This is OK by that way.)</span>

                    <span>There’s been a recent discussion on Twitter about the idea of adding a new element in HTML that represents a search interface. A search form, basically.
The idea is to create a semantic HTML element for the ARIA search role, which represents a landmark region “that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a search facility.”
Opinions have been shared in the Twitter thread about whether adding a new HTML element is necessary. Many have argued that it was unnecessary because we can use the ARIA search role and repurpose a form element to create the same semantics. I disagree. And this article is the longer version of my personal opinion on the subject.
tl;dr

                    <span>For web developers, a personal portfolio page is like a resume. Instead of listing your skills on a resume in the traditional way, you can prove your competence with a personal portfolio.
When people or potential employers see your portfolio, they can get a glimpse of your skills. Thus, online portfolios are a great way to showcase your work and skills.
However, creating an online portfolio is not straightforward for everyone. For example, you might struggle with questions such as:
What should I add to my portfolio?
How should I structure it?
What technologies should I use to build it?
As a result, I want to help you answer any questions you might have. In this article, you can see my favourite web developer portfolios from the internet. Hopefully, they will answer your questions and inspi…</span>

But when I heard a beta version of a Readwise plugin for Obsidian was released I started my 30 days testing period for Readwise. And it changed the way I write notes.
I read a lot: books, articles, or tweets and use Feedly (my RSS reader), Pocket, and Instapaper to highlight interesting sentences or paragraphs. I highlight on my Kindle, in Pocket, Feedly, PDF, and in Markdown files which made it confusing to find a highlight again later.
I highlight too much to extract everything into my Zettelkasten, but I would have loved to be able to search my highlights later. Searching in Feedly and Pocket is possible with a premium account but not comf…</span>

                    <span>Deploying an application created with a framework like React, Vue, or Angular differs significantly from deploying a website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Choosing a hosting provider for your app is very important, as your website performance depends on it. Here are some popular and free hosting services, that you can use to deploy your react app. 
Netlify
It&#x27;s the one I utilize for the majority of my projects. Netlify is a fantastic web development tool that is designed to help you increase your productivity as much as possible. Developers can use the platform to create, test, and deploy websites. Netlify is an incredibly rapid solution to assure that websites and apps are considerably more performant, scalable, and secure.

In this article, we are going to integrate Uploadcare ( An Advanced File Uploader ) which includes drag-and-drop image uploader, direct link image uploader and etc.. in our react.js app. 
Creating a react app
The first step is to create a simple react app which you can do just by running the command below in your terminal. 
npx create-react-app upload-care

This might take a while and it depends on your computer specs but once it is done go to the new directory which is created ( In our case upload-care ) and run npm start or yarn start. This command will start the development server for your react app. Now open this directory (In our case upload-care) in any code editor
Cleaning up the project
Once you opened the directory in your code editor, You can see that there are many file…</span>

                    <span>Hello and welcome to Part 2 of the GitHub Actions series. A series where we will walk through everything you need to know about GitHub Actions, from the basics to creating your own customized workflow.
If you have missed Part 1, please read it here before proceeding to Part 2.
In this part, let&#x27;s dive deeper into some attributes and useful things you need to know to customize a good workflow.
Job dependencies
Recap: Each workflow must have 1 job, each job has a unique identifier, they run in parallel by default.
As discussed in the previous part of this series, jobs are executed in parallel by default. In the example below, job1 and job2 will be run simultaneously.
jobs:
   job1: # unique identifier
      # job stuff here

   job2: # unique identifier
      # job stuff here
