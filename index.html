As movement toward memory-safe languages, and Rust in particular, continues to grow, it is worth looking at one of the larger scale efforts to port C code that has existed for decades to Rust. The uutils project aims to rewrite all of the individual utilities included in the GNU Coreutils project in Rust. Originally created by Jordi Boggiano in 2013, the project aims to provide drop-in replacements for the Coreutils programs, adding the data-race protection and memory safety that Rust provides.</span>

Only in the last few millennia have we begun to commit our conversations to writing, and only in the last few decades have we begun to outsource them to the computer, a machine that shows much more affinity for written correspondence than for the slangy vagaries of spoken language.
Computers have trouble because between spoken and written language, speech is more primordial. To have successful conversations with us, machines must grapple with the messiness of human speech: the disfluencies and pauses, the gestures and body language, an…</span>

                    <span>Gatsby recently announced the launch of “functions”. In this article, Paul Scanlon explains how to get the current location of the International Space Station (ISS) as it orbits the Earth in real-time using [Gatsby Functions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/functions/) and then display it on a 3D interactive globe using [React Three Fibre](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber).</span>

                    <span>Have you ever thought about trying TypeScript for your app’s front end? It’s enticing, but the thought of porting all that existing JS is just too much. But what if you could gradually introduce TypeScript into your existing app, only using it where it made sense? In this article, I’ll describe how to do just that.</span>

                    <span>With the release of the mobile versions of Obsidian last week, my note-taking workflow got even more comfortable.
The mobile versions are fantastic. They support all plugins of the Desktop version, even community plugins.
A few of the plugins do make not a lot of sense, though (like Sliding Panes on a mobile phone) and I hope a future version brings the option to turn off specific extensions just on mobile.
The mobile version has mobile-only settings, to customize the toolbar and quick action.

Synchronization
To sync between Desktop and mobile devices the Obsidian vaults have to be moved in an iCloud system folder.

Flash, Photoshop, and responsive design
When I first started designing websites, my go-to software was Photoshop. I created a 960px canvas and set about creating a layout that I would later drop content in. The development phase was about attaining pixel-perfect accuracy using fixed widths, fixed heights, and absolute positioning.
Ethan Marcotte’s talk at An Event Apart and subsequent article “Responsive Web Design” in A List Apart in 2010 changed all this. I was sold on responsive design as soon as I heard about it, but I was also terrified. The pixel-perfect designs f…</span>

For folks outside of America, the MPA (formally the MPAA) is the Motion Picture Association. They&#x27;re responsible for assigning ratings to movies released in America. There&#x27;s a lot to be said about these ratings, and if you haven&#x27;t seen it, I highly recommend &quot;This Film is Not Yet Rated&quot; as it details some of the hypocritical ratings giving out by the association.</span>
