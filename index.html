Google shows 7,930,000,000 results on &quot;Why JavaScript is hard to learn&quot;, Many developers don&#x27;t learn JavaScript and jump to some other alternative language ( Though each language has its own specialty ) because they think JavaScript is hard. But you shouldn&#x27;t be among those developers. In this article, you are going to learn about &quot;How can you learn JavaScript&quot;.

                    <span>Finding an open-source project to contribute can be a frustrating process. Especially when you are a beginner and all projects look overwhelming.
As a result, in this article, you will see a couple of ways and resources to find Open Source projects to contribute.

Creating tutorials and supporting material
Organising issues on Github
Translating the documentation and supporting material to other languages

                    <span>When my daily routines were changed by force by the Corona crisis, I picked up a new habit: Walking. Each day I walked around lakes and through forests in the morning, during lunchtime, or in the evening.
One day in the spring I saw an old man, sitting on a bench next to a lake in the forest. His foldable bike next to the bench, a binocular in his hands, he was watching birds.
The weeks went by and I saw him again and again. Our encounters started with a nod, then a short greeting, each time I passed by the bench. And one day he lifted his hand, signalizing me he would like to say something. I don’t remember what he wanted to talk about, maybe how nice the weather was or that he was happy it stopped raining.
Weeks passed and we greeted each other and sometimes we talked for a few minutes.

1. Understand the Business
Before even jumping into the codebase, I recommend understanding the &#x27;macros&#x27; aka the business behind the product you&#x27;re going to be responsible for. No need to understand every single intricacies about the company, but at least information around these few points:
Understand the value the company is giving to its customers

                    <span>Antiracist economist Kim Crayton says that “intention without strategy is chaos.” We’ve discussed how our biases, assumptions, and inattention toward marginalized and vulnerable groups lead to dangerous and unethical tech—but what, specifically, do we need to do to fix it?

                    <span>I’ve been enjoying learning poems for a few months now. It started when I heard a fantastic visual recitation by Lauren Southern of Rudyard Kiplings The Gods of the Copybook Headings.
The poem is an echo from 100 years ago. Full of wisdom and a mirror held up to our generation. It’s deep and not easy to understand which was the reason I dug into it. I wrote a modern interpretation of the poem a few month ago.
And then I started learning the poem. First for fun, and I wasn’t sure I would be able to remember it, because it’s long (10 stanzas with four lines). I was surprised and impressed when I was able to remember it after two weeks in its entirety.
I used a simple spaced-repetition method to remember it. There are countless apps like Anki that use this method. I used an app called NeuraCa…</span>

                    <span>Introduction
console.log() is a debugging tool that can assist you to figure out what your code is doing. You may follow along as your code executes by displaying a message that contains either descriptive text that tells you what&#x27;s going on or the values of certain variables.
Removing all console.log() from your project before production can be very difficult, Here is how to remove all console.log() from your project in less than a minute. 
Step 1
Open your project in VS Code ( Since we are using Regex, It is easier to use it in VS Code )
Step 2
Click on the search icon on VS Code sidebar. It will open the search option

Step 3
In search placeholder type console.log.*$ and select Use Regex option which can be found on the upper right corner of the search panel that’s designated by the icon .*

Step 4
Once you searched for all the console.log(), Click on replace to remove all console.log()
and BOOM 💥 Now you don&#x27;t have any console.log() in your project

                    <span>Google is such a dominant force in the search engine industry that it is the default search engine for Android smartphones and web browsers such as Chrome. To put it frankly, Google has become one of the most widely utilized online resources for discovering everything from random facts and music videos to products and services.
The sophisticated Google search methods and tips listed below can help you narrow your search results.
1. Site:
Using site: will search within a specific website. For example, if you want to find an article that is published only on Hackernoon, you can simply type 
site:hackernoon.com article_keyword


2. Asterisk *
You can use * to fill missing words or phrases, like :
How to integrate * in nodejs


3. Quotation &quot; &quot;
&quot;&quot; is used to search for words or phrases, like :
&quot;Why facebook created react&quot;


4. Related:
You can use related: to sites that are similar to other sites, for example
related:netflix.com


5. link:
Use link: to find a page that links to another page, like : 
link:suhailkakar.com

                    <span>Hey there, JavaScript Developers👩‍💻
In this article we&#x27;ll dig deeper into the concepts of Set and Map. 
What is a Set?
A Set is a collection of unique values. That means the set can never have any duplicates and can hold any values of any data type. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order.
Okay, this sounds interesting. So the question is how to create a set?
To create a set we write- new Set() and in the parentheses, we need to pass an iterable.
const ordersSet&#x3D; new Set([&#x27;Pasta&#x27;,&#x27;Pizza&#x27;,&#x27;Coffee&#x27;,&#x27;Pasta&#x27;,&#x27;Pizza&#x27;]);

console.log(ordersSet);  // {&#x27;Pasta&#x27;, &#x27;Pizza&#x27;, &#x27;Coffee&#x27;}

Here in the above example, we see some duplicate set elements like Pasta and Pizza. When we log in to the console we get a set that has a size of 3. 
You might think the elements were 5 before …</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone, Hashnode&#x27;s Auth0 hackathon is still ongoing. For those who have not used Auth0 before and just getting started on their hackathon projects to implement Auth0, here is a super quick step-by-step guide to set up and integrate it to a React app.
Step 1: Sign Up For An Account
Go to https://auth0.com/signup to create a free Auth0 account.

Follow the sign-up steps. You can continue with the default tenant domain name and region they set for you, or customize it yourself.

Tenant: represents the user domain that has access to the Auth0 application configurations, assets, connections, etc. The tenant domain name will be the URL used to access resources such as the Auth0 API.
Step 2: Create an Application
Now, you will be redirected to your Auth0 Dashboard. Let&#x27;s start by clicking…</span>

                    <span>The real division and conflict are not between Liberals and Conservatives as we always hear in the media. It is between those who want a strong, central government that controls the life of its citizens on the one side and those who want a transparent, slim government and strong, self-reliant citizens on the other side.
The real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians.

                    <span>Introduction 📚
When you go to GitHub and see some other developers code, most of them are importing their components like this👇
import Button from &quot;../../../components/Buttons/Button&quot;

This is called relative import. Relative import will start with either ./,/ or ../.
I am not telling that this is the wrong way and even there is no issue if you import like that, but if you have a very big and complex project, relative imports will look a lot messy similar to this. 
import Button from &quot;../../../../../../components/Buttons/Button&quot;

However, there is a very better and cleaner way to import these components. This method is called absolute import. An absolute import will look this like 👇
import Button from &quot;components/Buttons/Button&quot;

Adding absolute imports to React Apps (CRA) 💡
Open your project in any code editor and create a new file in your project&#x27;s root directory named jsconfig.json. Once you created the file paste the below JSON inside of it. 
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;baseUrl&quot;: &quot;src&quot;
  }
}

This will instruct Webpack to use the src directory as a base one.

Today, we&#x27;re going to take a look at some basic Mac Terminal/Linux commands in my experience. 
So, don&#x27;t roast me friends😅  I&#x27;m a n00b at this stuff, so I haven&#x27;t used shit like cat, grep, pbcopy or pbpaste yet.

Without further ado, let&#x27;s get fuckin started!!

1. pwd 🗺📍 
You can use the pwd command to find out your current location in the filesystem/name of the folder currently open in your terminal window. 
The output of pwd will look something like this:

After executing the pwd command, the terminal tells us that we&#x27;re in the folder called Yuri inside of the folder Users at root.

                    <span>Hey Readers 👋
In this article, we’ll learn about the optional chaining (?.) that simplifies the way to access values through nested objects.
What the heck is Optional chaining?  🥴
The optional chaining ?.  is a recent addition to the language which is a secure way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn’t exist. 
With the optional chaining if a certain property doesn&#x27;t exist then undefined is returned immediately.
The optional chaining ?. syntax has three forms:
obj?.prop – returns obj.prop if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj?.[prop] – returns obj[prop] if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj.method?.() – calls obj.method() if obj.method exists, otherwise returns undefined
To understand the concept better let&#x27;s have a look at a few of the use cases.…</span>

                    <span>Welcome back to GraphQL for Beginners! A beginner-friendly series introducing the basic concepts of GraphQL and how to connect it to a front-end framework like React using Apollo. 
In this part, we will complete our simple chat app by building our front-end with React and Apollo Client. 
If you haven&#x27;t read the previous part, please read it here.
Step 1: Create a React App
To recap, our project folder currently has a server folder in it. Let&#x27;s create a client folder now for our React app.
In our client folder, we can create a new React app:
npx create-react-app my-app

Now, your project folder should look something like this:

Step 2: Install packages
To connect our React app to our GraphQL server, we need to install a few packages:

It&#x27;s been around 20 days since I started blogging on Hashnode ( My main blog ), DEV, and Devdojo, and I reached more than 29,000 page views. Since then, I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of questions about how I increased my traffic, therefore I&#x27;ll put it all out in this article. 



As you can see, I received  11,109 visitors in DEV, 15,149 visitors in Hashnode, and 2,817 in Devdojo which is a total of 29,075. And the strategies that I used are
1. Publishing articles consistently

Thus, in this article, you will see how to do that! First, you will create an API from scratch, and then you will sell it on RapidAPI!
What&#x27;s an API?
Let&#x27;s start by refreshing our memory on what an API is. The acronym API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it&#x27;s a way for two computer programs to communicate between them.
In simple terms, it&#x27;s a piece of software offering its services to other programs through a pre-defined set of functions. The other programs do not need to know about the API implementation because the functions describe how the API can be used. You communicate with APIs through requests, and there are four types of requests…</span>

Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript. While JavaScript is not the only client-side scripting language on the Internet, it was one of the first and it is still the most widely used.

                    <span>This afternoon I was going through my &quot;blog ideas&quot; list and cleaning up entries I&#x27;ve changed my mind on. I came across something I added many months ago - using the Fetch API to upload multiple files at once. The reason it&#x27;s stuck in my &quot;todo&quot; pile for so long is that I wasn&#x27;t aware of a good service I could use to post my files against. I&#x27;ve done it before in Node.js and I know it&#x27;s something I could do locally in an hour, but honestly I just didn&#x27;t want to. That probably sounds a bit lazy but it&#x27;s honest. Today though I came across httpbin.org, an online service that lets you hit it with various types of HTTP methods and even supports file uploads. (Obviously it doesn&#x27;t make those files available, it just reports back on the upload.) Even better, it supports CORS which means I could use CodePen. So with no more excuses at my disposal, today I finally built a simple demo.</span>

                    <span>Yes, you can include HTML inside of HTML, just like a react / angular component. In this short article, I am going to walk you through, how to include HTML inside of HTML. 
Creating files
Go ahead and create a new HTML file and add the following simple code inside of it




    
    
    
    Include HTML inside of HTML






now create a new file and name it nav.html ( You can name it anything since this will be the component that we will include in index.html). Once created you can either write your component or paste this simple navbar code

                    <span>Welcome back to GraphQL for Beginners! A beginner-friendly series introducing the basic concepts of GraphQL and how to connect it to a front-end framework like React using Apollo. 
In this part, we will start building a GraphQL server for a simple chat app with React and Apollo Client. 
Sneak Peek:

If you haven&#x27;t read the previous part, please read it here.
Setting up GraphQL Server
First, we need a GraphQL server to receive and send queries to our client.
To recap about GraphQL servers, feel free to read Part 2 of the series.
Step 1: Initialize project
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, install it here.
Then, create a new project with the following commands in the terminal:
mkdir project   // create project folder
mkdir project/server    // create server folder…</span>

                    <span>In the 1950s, many in the elite running community had begun to believe it wasn’t possible to run a mile in less than four minutes. Runners had been attempting it since the late 19th century and were beginning to draw the conclusion that the human body simply wasn’t built for the task. 
But on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England—conditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting—and yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes. 
This shift in the benchmark had profound effects; the world now knew that the four-minute mile was possible. Bannister’s record lasted only forty-six days, when it was snatched away by Australian ru…</span>

                    <span>A few days ago Hashnode announced that they are partnering with Auth0 for a hackathon with some prize money on the line, but In my point of view most of you guys didn&#x27;t know much about Auth0 and their SDKs. so I thought it would be a good opportunity for you to learn about them now. Therefore in this article, I am going to teach you how to integrate Auth0 with React JS ( A popular JavaScript frontend library). 
Creating a react app
The first step is to create a simple react app which you can do just by running the command below in your terminal. 
npx create-react-app react-auth0

This might take a while and it depends on your computer specs but once it is done go to the new directory which is created ( In our case react-auth0 ) and run npm start or yarn start. This command will start the d…</span>
