                    <span>Introduction
console.log() is a debugging tool that can assist you to figure out what your code is doing. You may follow along as your code executes by displaying a message that contains either descriptive text that tells you what&#x27;s going on or the values of certain variables.
Removing all console.log() from your project before production can be very difficult, Here is how to remove all console.log() from your project in less than a minute. 
Step 1
Open your project in VS Code ( Since we are using Regex, It is easier to use it in VS Code )
Step 2
Click on the search icon on VS Code sidebar. It will open the search option

Step 3
In search placeholder type console.log.*$ and select Use Regex option which can be found on the upper right corner of the search panel that‚Äôs designated by the icon .*

Step 4
Once you searched for all the console.log(), Click on replace to remove all console.log()
and BOOM üí• Now you don&#x27;t have any console.log() in your project

                    <span>Google is such a dominant force in the search engine industry that it is the default search engine for Android smartphones and web browsers such as Chrome. To put it frankly, Google has become one of the most widely utilized online resources for discovering everything from random facts and music videos to products and services.
The sophisticated Google search methods and tips listed below can help you narrow your search results.
1. Site:
Using site: will search within a specific website. For example, if you want to find an article that is published only on Hackernoon, you can simply type 
site:hackernoon.com article_keyword


2. Asterisk *
You can use * to fill missing words or phrases, like :
How to integrate * in nodejs


3. Quotation &quot; &quot;
&quot;&quot; is used to search for words or phrases, like :
&quot;Why facebook created react&quot;


4. Related:
You can use related: to sites that are similar to other sites, for example
related:netflix.com


5. link:
Use link: to find a page that links to another page, like : 
link:suhailkakar.com

                    <span>Hey there, JavaScript Developersüë©‚Äçüíª
In this article we&#x27;ll dig deeper into the concepts of Set and Map. 
What is a Set?
A Set is a collection of unique values. That means the set can never have any duplicates and can hold any values of any data type. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order.
Okay, this sounds interesting. So the question is how to create a set?
To create a set we write- new Set() and in the parentheses, we need to pass an iterable.
const ordersSet&#x3D; new Set([&#x27;Pasta&#x27;,&#x27;Pizza&#x27;,&#x27;Coffee&#x27;,&#x27;Pasta&#x27;,&#x27;Pizza&#x27;]);

console.log(ordersSet);  // {&#x27;Pasta&#x27;, &#x27;Pizza&#x27;, &#x27;Coffee&#x27;}

Here in the above example, we see some duplicate set elements like Pasta and Pizza. When we log in to the console we get a set that has a size of 3. 
You might think the elements were 5 before ‚Ä¶</span>

Step 1: Sign Up For An Account
Go to https://auth0.com/signup to create a free Auth0 account.

Follow the sign-up steps. You can continue with the default tenant domain name and region they set for you, or customize it yourself.

Tenant: represents the user domain that has access to the Auth0 application configurations, assets, connections, etc. The tenant domain name will be the URL used to access resources such as the Auth0 API.
Step 2: Create an Application
Now, you will be redirected to your Auth0 Dashboard. Let&#x27;s start by clicking‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Introduction üìö
When you go to GitHub and see some other developers code, most of them are importing their components like thisüëá
import Button from &quot;../../../components/Buttons/Button&quot;

This is called relative import. Relative import will start with either ./,/ or ../.
I am not telling that this is the wrong way and even there is no issue if you import like that, but if you have a very big and complex project, relative imports will look a lot messy similar to this. 
import Button from &quot;../../../../../../components/Buttons/Button&quot;

However, there is a very better and cleaner way to import these components. This method is called absolute import. An absolute import will look this like üëá
import Button from &quot;components/Buttons/Button&quot;

Adding absolute imports to React Apps (CRA) üí°
Open your project in any code editor and create a new file in your project&#x27;s root directory named jsconfig.json. Once you created the file paste the below JSON inside of it. 
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;baseUrl&quot;: &quot;src&quot;
  }
}

This will instruct Webpack to use the src directory as a base one.

                    <span>Hey Readers üëã
In this article, we‚Äôll learn about the optional chaining (?.) that simplifies the way to access values through nested objects.
What the heck is Optional chaining?  ü•¥
The optional chaining ?.  is a recent addition to the language which is a secure way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn‚Äôt exist. 
With the optional chaining if a certain property doesn&#x27;t exist then undefined is returned immediately.
The optional chaining ?. syntax has three forms:
obj?.prop ‚Äì returns obj.prop if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj?.[prop] ‚Äì returns obj[prop] if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj.method?.() ‚Äì calls obj.method() if obj.method exists, otherwise returns undefined
To understand the concept better let&#x27;s have a look at a few of the use cases.‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Welcome back to GraphQL for Beginners! A beginner-friendly series introducing the basic concepts of GraphQL and how to connect it to a front-end framework like React using Apollo. 
In this part, we will complete our simple chat app by building our front-end with React and Apollo Client. 
If you haven&#x27;t read the previous part, please read it here.
Step 1: Create a React App
To recap, our project folder currently has a server folder in it. Let&#x27;s create a client folder now for our React app.
In our client folder, we can create a new React app:
npx create-react-app my-app

Now, your project folder should look something like this:

Step 2: Install packages
To connect our React app to our GraphQL server, we need to install a few packages:

I wanted to share this guide to designing accessible focus indicators because focus styles are a recurring discussion I have with designers I work with on most projects, so I thought it would be useful to provide this guide as a helpful reference. This guide is aimed at both designers who want to learn about accessibility considerations for designing focus indicators, as well as developers who want to implement them.

Thus, in this article, you will see how to do that! First, you will create an API from scratch, and then you will sell it on RapidAPI!
What&#x27;s an API?
Let&#x27;s start by refreshing our memory on what an API is. The acronym API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it&#x27;s a way for two computer programs to communicate between them.
In simple terms, it&#x27;s a piece of software offering its services to other programs through a pre-defined set of functions. The other programs do not need to know about the API implementation because the functions describe how the API can be used. You communicate with APIs through requests, and there are four types of requests‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>JavaScript is a programming language used primarily by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript. While JavaScript is not the only client-side scripting language on the Internet, it was one of the first and it is still the most widely used.

                    <span>This afternoon I was going through my &quot;blog ideas&quot; list and cleaning up entries I&#x27;ve changed my mind on. I came across something I added many months ago - using the Fetch API to upload multiple files at once. The reason it&#x27;s stuck in my &quot;todo&quot; pile for so long is that I wasn&#x27;t aware of a good service I could use to post my files against. I&#x27;ve done it before in Node.js and I know it&#x27;s something I could do locally in an hour, but honestly I just didn&#x27;t want to. That probably sounds a bit lazy but it&#x27;s honest. Today though I came across httpbin.org, an online service that lets you hit it with various types of HTTP methods and even supports file uploads. (Obviously it doesn&#x27;t make those files available, it just reports back on the upload.) Even better, it supports CORS which means I could use CodePen. So with no more excuses at my disposal, today I finally built a simple demo.</span>

                    <span>Yes, you can include HTML inside of HTML, just like a react / angular component. In this short article, I am going to walk you through, how to include HTML inside of HTML. 
Creating files
Go ahead and create a new HTML file and add the following simple code inside of it




    
    
    
    Include HTML inside of HTML






now create a new file and name it nav.html ( You can name it anything since this will be the component that we will include in index.html). Once created you can either write your component or paste this simple navbar code

In this part, we will start building a GraphQL server for a simple chat app with React and Apollo Client. 
Sneak Peek:

Setting up GraphQL Server
First, we need a GraphQL server to receive and send queries to our client.
To recap about GraphQL servers, feel free to read Part 2 of the series.
Step 1: Initialize project
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, install it here.
Then, create a new project with the following commands in the terminal:
mkdir project   // create project folder
mkdir project/server    // create server folder‚Ä¶</span>

Runners had been attempting it since the late 19th century and were beginning to draw the conclusion that the human body simply wasn‚Äôt built for the task.¬†
But on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England‚Äîconditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting‚Äîand yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes.¬†

Therefore in this article, I am going to teach you how to integrate Auth0 with React JS ( A popular JavaScript frontend library). 
Creating a react app
The first step is to create a simple react app which you can do just by running the command below in your terminal. 
npx create-react-app react-auth0

This might take a while and it depends on your computer specs but once it is done go to the new directory which is created ( In our case react-auth0 ) and run npm start or yarn start. This command will start the d‚Ä¶</span>

Node.js is an open-source, JavaScript runtime environment on Chrome‚Äôs V8 that lets you effortlessly develop fast and scalable web applications. It utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight, efficient, and excellent for data-intensive real-time applications that run across shared devices.
Twilio Verify is a comprehensive solution for validating end-user phone numbers, which will be used to deliver a numeric code to the Android / iOS app through text message. Our server app will sit in between our app and Verify, allowing us to verify a user&#x27;s phone number once they sign up for your mobile app.

As movement toward memory-safe languages, and Rust in particular, continues to grow, it is worth looking at one of the larger scale efforts to port C code that has existed for decades to Rust. The uutils project aims to rewrite all of the individual utilities included in the GNU Coreutils project in Rust. Originally created by Jordi Boggiano in 2013, the project aims to provide drop-in replacements for the Coreutils programs, adding the data-race protection and memory safety that Rust provides.</span>

A beginner-friendly series introducing the basic concepts of GraphQL and how to connect it to a front-end framework like React using Apollo.

Subscriptions
In Part 1, we learnt about the 2 operations GraphQL supports: queries and mutations. The third type is known as subscriptions. 
Subscriptions are the operation used to push data from the server to the client on a specified event. Like queries, they fetch data and return it, but only when a certain change happens. Thus, subscriptions work by having an active connection to your GraphQL server (i.e. via WebSocket), where it will listen for a ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Let me begin by being very clear. This is not a very good idea. I just got back from a much delayed honeymoon with my wife (apparently right before the mask mandates all come crashing back) and haven&#x27;t written code for a while so perhaps I was a bit desperate to create something useless. That being said, working on this did let me kick the tires a bit on a few Eleventy things and that&#x27;s always a good idea.</span>

Whether to convey information, conduct transactions, or simply to check in on one another, people have yammered away, chattering and gesticulating, through spoken conversation for countless generations. Only in the last few millennia have we begun to commit our conversations to writing, and only in the last few decades have we begun to outsource them to the computer, a machine that shows much more affinity for written correspondence than for the slangy vagaries of spoken language.
Computers have trouble because between spoken and written language, speech is more primordial. To have successful conversations with us, machines must grapple with the messiness of human speech: the disfluencies and pauses, the gestures and body language, an‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Introduction
JavaScript is a scripting language for building dynamic web pages. It adhered to client-side development principles, thus it operates entirely within the user&#x27;s web browser and requires no resources from the web server. Javascript may also be used with other technologies such as REST APIs, XML, and others.
Typescript is a superset of Javascript. It is a statically built language for writing Javascript code that is straightforward and simple. It may be used with Node.js or any browser that supports ECMAScript 3 or above. 
Difference Between Javascript and Typescript

To make the code comprehensible for browsers, it will convert to JavaScript code.

                    <span>Contributing to open-source is a great way to improve your programming skills, help others and learn how to work in a collaborative environment.
However, many people are put off by the complexity of the projects. They also think that contributing to open-source is all about coding.
But that is not true! You can contribute to open source projects in other ways, such as:
Writing documentation
Creating supporting materials
Reviewing code
Translating to other languages
Structure and re-structure the code and project structure
Thus, in this article, you will learn how to make your first open-source contributions with the help of Hashnode documentation. Hashnode is a blogging platform that open-sourced their documentation, which is a great place to start your open-source journey.

Introduction
Every developer&#x27;s job entails some kind of product design. It&#x27;s not just about having a good appearance; it&#x27;s also about having engaging visuals and a good overall presentation. Rather of spending time and money on a lengthy design process, it is preferable to leverage resources that offer ready-to-use components and features for a fantastic, amazing, and outstanding product.

Don&#x27;t do this to anyone with ill intent, this is a legit hacking tool part of the hacking process called osens, where we gather information about our hacking targets. What we&#x27;re doing is not technically illegal we&#x27;re just gathering publicly available information on the internet but the lines can blur based on your intentions so just be careful use this as a learning tool.
Introduction
Sherlock is a powerful command line tool supplied by the Sherlock Project that may be used to locate usernames across a variety of social media platforms. It is a python open-source project available at GitHub. You just need to input the username and Sherlock will return all the social media account url of that username
Requirement
This best thing about this project is that you don&#x27;t need any extra thing, You just need a web browser
How To Use ?
Open this  link  in your browser. This will open Google Cloud Console which we can use its shell to install Sherlock
Make sure to check the Trust checkbox and click on Confirm and wait for 10 seconds 

Once everything is done, go a head and paste the below code in the Cloud Shell 
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

If all the packages are installed successfully, you should see something similar to below picture

Now we can start using Sherlock, you just need to a username to get the social media account. In the Cloud Shell paste the below code and click enter ( change username with the account you want to get information, In my case suhailkakar) and will get all the social media profile of the username
python3 sherlock --timeout 1 username

For many developers, freelancing is profitable source of income.  Some people take it as a full-time job, while others do it as a part-time job to earn additional cash. Some platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and many more offer a great opportunity for anyone to start freelancing, but there is a lot of competition there, so be sure to stand out among them 

2. Sell an Ebook
Writing an ebook is one of those things that may pay off for a long time. You can write a highly useful ebook as a developer that covers a certain topic of software development. Alternatively, you may opt to describe a programming language in such a way that your readers will have a better understanding of it.

Since our last look at the project, way back in 2013, it has seen lots of new releases with features, bug fixes, and refinements aimed at appealing to a wide range of users.</span>
