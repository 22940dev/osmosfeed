In this previous part, we learned about secrets, how to use actions from different sources and pass arguments using with. We also created a simple automate pull request review workflow after putting together all that we have learned.
If you have missed it, please read Part 3 here.
This part of the series will be an exciting one. We will develop a CI/CD workflow to automate linting, testing and deploying an app using GitHub Actions. Without further ado, let&#x27;s begin!

Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an omnichannel content strategy, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.
But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future?

We&#x27;ve got a very active set of forums but I know that most developers tend to use StackOverflow for all their support needs. At the time I joined, we didn&#x27;t really have tags that were being used consistently, so myself and others figured out what tag names were going to use, updated some older questions to use the right tags, and even seeded a few questions ourselves.

                    <span>There’s been a recent discussion on Twitter about the idea of adding a new element in HTML that represents a search interface. A search form, basically.
The idea is to create a semantic HTML element for the ARIA search role, which represents a landmark region “that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a search facility.”
Opinions have been shared in the Twitter thread about whether adding a new HTML element is necessary. Many have argued that it was unnecessary because we can use the ARIA search role and repurpose a form element to create the same semantics. I disagree. And this article is the longer version of my personal opinion on the subject.

                    <span>For years, pseudo-elements have faithfully helped front-end developers implement creative designs. While they still have an important place, we can now leave pseudo-elements behind in some scenarios, thanks to newer CSS properties.</span>

                    <span>For web developers, a personal portfolio page is like a resume. Instead of listing your skills on a resume in the traditional way, you can prove your competence with a personal portfolio.
When people or potential employers see your portfolio, they can get a glimpse of your skills. Thus, online portfolios are a great way to showcase your work and skills.
However, creating an online portfolio is not straightforward for everyone. For example, you might struggle with questions such as:
What should I add to my portfolio?
How should I structure it?
What technologies should I use to build it?
As a result, I want to help you answer any questions you might have. In this article, you can see my favourite web developer portfolios from the internet. Hopefully, they will answer your questions and inspi…</span>

                    <span>I recently rediscovered Readwise again. I’ve heard of the service before, but couldn’t see the immediate advantage for me and had forgotten it again.
But when I heard a beta version of a Readwise plugin for Obsidian was released I started my 30 days testing period for Readwise. And it changed the way I write notes.
I read a lot: books, articles, or tweets and use Feedly (my RSS reader), Pocket, and Instapaper to highlight interesting sentences or paragraphs. I highlight on my Kindle, in Pocket, Feedly, PDF, and in Markdown files which made it confusing to find a highlight again later.
I highlight too much to extract everything into my Zettelkasten, but I would have loved to be able to search my highlights later. Searching in Feedly and Pocket is possible with a premium account but not comf…</span>

                    <span>Deploying an application created with a framework like React, Vue, or Angular differs significantly from deploying a website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Choosing a hosting provider for your app is very important, as your website performance depends on it. Here are some popular and free hosting services, that you can use to deploy your react app. 
Netlify
It&#x27;s the one I utilize for the majority of my projects. Netlify is a fantastic web development tool that is designed to help you increase your productivity as much as possible. Developers can use the platform to create, test, and deploy websites. Netlify is an incredibly rapid solution to assure that websites and apps are considerably more performant, scalable, and secure.

In this article, we are going to integrate Upload Care ( An Advanced File Uploader ) which includes drag-and-drop image uploader, direct link image uploader and etc.. in our react.js app. 
Creating a react app
The first step is to create a simple react app which you can do just by running the command below in your terminal. 
npx create-react-app upload-care

This might take a while and it depends on your computer specs but once it is done go to the new directory which is created ( In our case upload-care ) and run npm start or yarn start. This command will start the development server for your react app. Now open this directory (In our case upload-care) in any code editor
Cleaning up the project

If you have missed Part 1, please read it here before proceeding to Part 2.
In this part, let&#x27;s dive deeper into some attributes and useful things you need to know to customize a good workflow.
Job dependencies
Recap: Each workflow must have 1 job, each job has a unique identifier, they run in parallel by default.
As discussed in the previous part of this series, jobs are executed in parallel by default. In the example below, job1 and job2 will be run simultaneously.
jobs:
   job1: # unique identifier

                    <span>People always think they wouldn’t have taken part in the unjust and evil deeds of totalitarian rule. But most of them are wrong, the Corona crisis proved this to me. Most people either cheer for unjust and evil or stay silent. Only a few see the creeping loss of freedom, one step at a time until it is a hundred little steps.
You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow […] But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. […] If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes millions would have been sufficiently shocked […] But of course, this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next.

Thus, in this article, I want to discuss how I received the role and what it&#x27;s like to be a Developer Advocate.
Why am I writing this article


First of all, I received the job by putting my work online and by networking. Thus, I want to show the power of social media. Secondly, many people asked me about what it&#x27;s like to work as a Developer Advocate. So, I want to share my experience with them.

Google shows 7,930,000,000 results on &quot;Why JavaScript is hard to learn&quot;, Many developers don&#x27;t learn JavaScript and jump to some other alternative language ( Though each language has its own specialty ) because they think JavaScript is hard.

As a result, in this article, you will see a couple of ways and resources to find Open Source projects to contribute.
Ways to contribute to a project


Before continuing further, let&#x27;s talk about a common misconception. Many developers have the misconception that contributing to open source is all about programming. 
Thankfully, that is false, and there are many other ways to contribute to open-source. Some of the ways you can contribute are as follows:
Writing and improving the documentation
Creating tutorials and supporting material
Organising issues on Github
Translating the documentation and supporting material to other languages

                    <span>When my daily routines were changed by force by the Corona crisis, I picked up a new habit: Walking. Each day I walked around lakes and through forests in the morning, during lunchtime, or in the evening.
One day in the spring I saw an old man, sitting on a bench next to a lake in the forest. His foldable bike next to the bench, a binocular in his hands, he was watching birds.
The weeks went by and I saw him again and again. Our encounters started with a nod, then a short greeting, each time I passed by the bench. And one day he lifted his hand, signalizing me he would like to say something. I don’t remember what he wanted to talk about, maybe how nice the weather was or that he was happy it stopped raining.
Weeks passed and we greeted each other and sometimes we talked for a few minutes.

1. Understand the Business

Understand the value the company is giving to its customers
