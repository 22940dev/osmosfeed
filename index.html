                    <span>There’s been a recent discussion on Twitter about the idea of adding a new element in HTML that represents a search interface. A search form, basically.
The idea is to create a semantic HTML element for the ARIA search role, which represents a landmark region “that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a search facility.”
Opinions have been shared in the Twitter thread about whether adding a new HTML element is necessary. Many have argued that it was unnecessary because we can use the ARIA search role and repurpose a form element to create the same semantics. I disagree. And this article is the longer version of my personal opinion on the subject.

However, creating an online portfolio is not straightforward for everyone. For example, you might struggle with questions such as:
What should I add to my portfolio?
How should I structure it?
What technologies should I use to build it?

                    <span>I recently rediscovered Readwise again. I’ve heard of the service before, but couldn’t see the immediate advantage for me and had forgotten it again.
But when I heard a beta version of a Readwise plugin for Obsidian was released I started my 30 days testing period for Readwise. And it changed the way I write notes.
I read a lot: books, articles, or tweets and use Feedly (my RSS reader), Pocket, and Instapaper to highlight interesting sentences or paragraphs. I highlight on my Kindle, in Pocket, Feedly, PDF, and in Markdown files which made it confusing to find a highlight again later.
I highlight too much to extract everything into my Zettelkasten, but I would have loved to be able to search my highlights later. Searching in Feedly and Pocket is possible with a premium account but not comf…</span>

                    <span>Deploying an application created with a framework like React, Vue, or Angular differs significantly from deploying a website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Choosing a hosting provider for your app is very important, as your website performance depends on it. Here are some popular and free hosting services, that you can use to deploy your react app. 
Netlify
It&#x27;s the one I utilize for the majority of my projects. Netlify is a fantastic web development tool that is designed to help you increase your productivity as much as possible. Developers can use the platform to create, test, and deploy websites. Netlify is an incredibly rapid solution to assure that websites and apps are considerably more performant, scalable, and secure.

In this article, we are going to integrate Upload Care ( An Advanced File Uploader ) which includes drag-and-drop image uploader, direct link image uploader and etc.. in our react.js app. 
Creating a react app
The first step is to create a simple react app which you can do just by running the command below in your terminal. 
npx create-react-app upload-care

This might take a while and it depends on your computer specs but once it is done go to the new directory which is created ( In our case upload-care ) and run npm start or yarn start. This command will start the development server for your react app. Now open this directory (In our case upload-care) in any code editor
Cleaning up the project

&lt;div class&#x3D;&quot;C(#333) P(20px)&quot;text
&lt;/div
And it will generate CSS like:
.C\(\#333\) {

If you have missed Part 1, please read it here before proceeding to Part 2.
In this part, let&#x27;s dive deeper into some attributes and useful things you need to know to customize a good workflow.
Job dependencies
Recap: Each workflow must have 1 job, each job has a unique identifier, they run in parallel by default.
As discussed in the previous part of this series, jobs are executed in parallel by default. In the example below, job1 and job2 will be run simultaneously.
jobs:

Thus, in this article, I want to discuss how I received the role and what it&#x27;s like to be a Developer Advocate.
Why am I writing this article


First of all, I received the job by putting my work online and by networking. Thus, I want to show the power of social media. Secondly, many people asked me about what it&#x27;s like to work as a Developer Advocate. So, I want to share my experience with them.
Is this a promotional article? Absolutely not. I do not promote Hashnode because I work there. I work at Hashnode because I love the product. Whether I work at Hashnode or not, it does not change how I feel about Hashnode, the blogging platform. First and foremost, I am…</span>

Google shows 7,930,000,000 results on &quot;Why JavaScript is hard to learn&quot;, Many developers don&#x27;t learn JavaScript and jump to some other alternative language ( Though each language has its own specialty ) because they think JavaScript is hard.

As a result, in this article, you will see a couple of ways and resources to find Open Source projects to contribute.
Ways to contribute to a project


Before continuing further, let&#x27;s talk about a common misconception. Many developers have the misconception that contributing to open source is all about programming. 
Thankfully, that is false, and there are many other ways to contribute to open-source. Some of the ways you can contribute are as follows:
Writing and improving the documentation
Creating tutorials and supporting material
Organising issues on Github
Translating the documentation and supporting material to other languages

One day in the spring I saw an old man, sitting on a bench next to a lake in the forest. His foldable bike next to the bench, a binocular in his hands, he was watching birds.
The weeks went by and I saw him again and again. Our encounters started with a nod, then a short greeting, each time I passed by the bench. And one day he lifted his hand, signalizing me he would like to say something. I don’t remember what he wanted to talk about, maybe how nice the weather was or that he was happy it stopped raining.
Weeks passed and we greeted each other and sometimes we talked for a few minutes.

                    <span>Whether you are starting a new job or contributing to an open source project, there are times when you will need to quickly ramp up and get familiar with a large code base. In this article, let&#x27;s discuss some tips to get started with becoming familiar with any code base easily.
1. Understand the Business
Before even jumping into the codebase, I recommend understanding the &#x27;macros&#x27; aka the business behind the product you&#x27;re going to be responsible for. No need to understand every single intricacies about the company, but at least information around these few points:
Understand the value the company is giving to its customers
Know what software are currently in development (and which one you&#x27;re likely to be working on)
Know the business context of the app, the purpose it serves for the compa…</span>

                    <span>Antiracist economist Kim Crayton says that “intention without strategy is chaos.” We’ve discussed how our biases, assumptions, and inattention toward marginalized and vulnerable groups lead to dangerous and unethical tech—but what, specifically, do we need to do to fix it? The intention to make our tech safer is not enough; we need a strategy.
This chapter will equip you with that plan of action. It covers how to integrate safety principles into your design work in order to create tech that’s safe, how to convince your stakeholders that this work is necessary, and how to respond to the critique that what we actually need is more diversity. (Spoiler: we do, but diversity alone is not the antidote to fixing unethical, unsafe tech.)

In this tutorial, we’ll be building a RESTful CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
Creating the application
On your Desktop ( or any other place ) create a new folder named nodejs-api and open it in any Code Editor (for this Tutorial I am using VS Code).  Once you done open terminal ( You can either use VS Code terminal or external terminal ) and run

                    <span>I’ve been enjoying learning poems for a few months now. It started when I heard a fantastic visual recitation by Lauren Southern of Rudyard Kiplings The Gods of the Copybook Headings.
The poem is an echo from 100 years ago. Full of wisdom and a mirror held up to our generation. It’s deep and not easy to understand which was the reason I dug into it. I wrote a modern interpretation of the poem a few month ago.
And then I started learning the poem. First for fun, and I wasn’t sure I would be able to remember it, because it’s long (10 stanzas with four lines). I was surprised and impressed when I was able to remember it after two weeks in its entirety.

                    <span>Introduction
console.log() is a debugging tool that can assist you to figure out what your code is doing. You may follow along as your code executes by displaying a message that contains either descriptive text that tells you what&#x27;s going on or the values of certain variables.
Removing all console.log() from your project before production can be very difficult, Here is how to remove all console.log() from your project in less than a minute. 
Step 1
Open your project in VS Code ( Since we are using Regex, It is easier to use it in VS Code )
Step 2
Click on the search icon on VS Code sidebar. It will open the search option

Step 3
In search placeholder type console.log.*$ and select Use Regex option which can be found on the upper right corner of the search panel that’s designated by the icon .*

Step 4
Once you searched for all the console.log(), Click on replace to remove all console.log()
and BOOM 💥 Now you don&#x27;t have any console.log() in your project
