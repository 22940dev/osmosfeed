                    <span>Overview
In this article, we are going to integrate Upload Care ( An Advanced File Uploader ) which includes drag-and-drop image uploader, direct link image uploader and etc.. in our react.js app. 
Creating a react app
The first step is to create a simple react app which you can do just by running the command below in your terminal. 
npx create-react-app upload-care

This might take a while and it depends on your computer specs but once it is done go to the new directory which is created ( In our case upload-care ) and run npm start or yarn start. This command will start the development server for your react app. Now open this directory (In our case upload-care) in any code editor
Cleaning up the project
Once you opened the directory in your code editor, You can see that there are many fil‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I believe acss.io is the first usage of ‚ÄúAtomic CSS‚Äù where the point of it is to be a compiler. You write CSS like this:
&lt;div class&#x3D;&quot;C(#fff) P(20px)&quot;text
&lt;/div
And it will generate CSS like:
.C\(\#333\) {
  color: #333;

If you have missed Part 1, please read it here before proceeding to Part 2.
In this part, let&#x27;s dive deeper into some attributes and useful things you need to know to customize a good workflow.
Job dependencies
Recap: Each workflow must have 1 job, each job has a unique identifier, they run in parallel by default.
As discussed in the previous part of this series, jobs are executed in parallel by default. In the example below, job1 and job2 will be run simultaneously.
jobs:

Google shows 7,930,000,000 results on &quot;Why JavaScript is hard to learn&quot;, Many developers don&#x27;t learn JavaScript and jump to some other alternative language ( Though each language has its own specialty ) because they think JavaScript is hard.

                    <span>Finding an open-source project to contribute can be a frustrating process. Especially when you are a beginner and all projects look overwhelming.
As a result, in this article, you will see a couple of ways and resources to find Open Source projects to contribute.
Ways to contribute to a project


Before continuing further, let&#x27;s talk about a common misconception. Many developers have the misconception that contributing to open source is all about programming. 
Thankfully, that is false, and there are many other ways to contribute to open-source. Some of the ways you can contribute are as follows:
Writing and improving the documentation
Creating tutorials and supporting material
Organising issues on Github
Translating the documentation and supporting material to other languages
Reviewing co‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>When my daily routines were changed by force by the Corona crisis, I picked up a new habit: Walking. Each day I walked around lakes and through forests in the morning, during lunchtime, or in the evening.
One day in the spring I saw an old man, sitting on a bench next to a lake in the forest. His foldable bike next to the bench, a binocular in his hands, he was watching birds.
The weeks went by and I saw him again and again. Our encounters started with a nod, then a short greeting, each time I passed by the bench. And one day he lifted his hand, signalizing me he would like to say something. I don‚Äôt remember what he wanted to talk about, maybe how nice the weather was or that he was happy it stopped raining.
Weeks passed and we greeted each other and sometimes we talked for a few minutes.

                    <span>Whether you are starting a new job or contributing to an open source project, there are times when you will need to quickly ramp up and get familiar with a large code base. In this article, let&#x27;s discuss some tips to get started with becoming familiar with any code base easily.
1. Understand the Business
Before even jumping into the codebase, I recommend understanding the &#x27;macros&#x27; aka the business behind the product you&#x27;re going to be responsible for. No need to understand every single intricacies about the company, but at least information around these few points:
Understand the value the company is giving to its customers
Know what software are currently in development (and which one you&#x27;re likely to be working on)
Know the business context of the app, the purpose it serves for the compa‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Antiracist economist Kim Crayton says that ‚Äúintention without strategy is chaos.‚Äù We‚Äôve discussed how our biases, assumptions, and inattention toward marginalized and vulnerable groups lead to dangerous and unethical tech‚Äîbut what, specifically, do we need to do to fix it? The intention to make our tech safer is not enough; we need a strategy.
This chapter will equip you with that plan of action. It covers how to integrate safety principles into your design work in order to create tech that‚Äôs safe, how to convince your stakeholders that this work is necessary, and how to respond to the critique that what we actually need is more diversity. (Spoiler: we do, but diversity alone is not the antidote to fixing unethical, unsafe tech.)

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll be building a RESTful CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
Creating the application
On your Desktop ( or any other place ) create a new folder named nodejs-api and open it in any Code Editor (for this Tutorial I am using VS Code).  Once you done open terminal ( You can either use VS Code terminal or external terminal ) and run

The poem is an echo from 100 years ago. Full of wisdom and a mirror held up to our generation. It‚Äôs deep and not easy to understand which was the reason I dug into it. I wrote a modern interpretation of the poem a few month ago.
And then I started learning the poem. First for fun, and I wasn‚Äôt sure I would be able to remember it, because it‚Äôs long (10 stanzas with four lines). I was surprised and impressed when I was able to remember it after two weeks in its entirety.
I used a simple spaced-repetition method to remember it. There are countless apps like Anki that use this method. I used an app called NeuraCa‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Introduction
console.log() is a debugging tool that can assist you to figure out what your code is doing. You may follow along as your code executes by displaying a message that contains either descriptive text that tells you what&#x27;s going on or the values of certain variables.
Removing all console.log() from your project before production can be very difficult, Here is how to remove all console.log() from your project in less than a minute. 
Step 1
Open your project in VS Code ( Since we are using Regex, It is easier to use it in VS Code )
Step 2
Click on the search icon on VS Code sidebar. It will open the search option

Step 3
In search placeholder type console.log.*$ and select Use Regex option which can be found on the upper right corner of the search panel that‚Äôs designated by the icon .*

Step 4
Once you searched for all the console.log(), Click on replace to remove all console.log()
and BOOM üí• Now you don&#x27;t have any console.log() in your project
Conclusion ‚åõ

                    <span>Google is such a dominant force in the search engine industry that it is the default search engine for Android smartphones and web browsers such as Chrome. To put it frankly, Google has become one of the most widely utilized online resources for discovering everything from random facts and music videos to products and services.
The sophisticated Google search methods and tips listed below can help you narrow your search results.
1. Site:
Using site: will search within a specific website. For example, if you want to find an article that is published only on Hackernoon, you can simply type 
site:hackernoon.com article_keyword


2. Asterisk *
You can use * to fill missing words or phrases, like :
How to integrate * in nodejs


3. Quotation &quot; &quot;
&quot;&quot; is used to search for words or phrases, like :
&quot;Why facebook created react&quot;


4. Related:
You can use related: to sites that are similar to other sites, for example
related:netflix.com


5. link:
Use link: to find a page that links to another page, like : 
link:suhailkakar.com

                    <span>Hey there, JavaScript Developersüë©‚Äçüíª
In this article we&#x27;ll dig deeper into the concepts of Set and Map. 
What is a Set?
A Set is a collection of unique values. That means the set can never have any duplicates and can hold any values of any data type. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order.
Okay, this sounds interesting. So the question is how to create a set?
To create a set we write- new Set() and in the parentheses, we need to pass an iterable.
const ordersSet&#x3D; new Set([&#x27;Pasta&#x27;,&#x27;Pizza&#x27;,&#x27;Coffee&#x27;,&#x27;Pasta&#x27;,&#x27;Pizza&#x27;]);

console.log(ordersSet);  // {&#x27;Pasta&#x27;, &#x27;Pizza&#x27;, &#x27;Coffee&#x27;}

Here in the above example, we see some duplicate set elements like Pasta and Pizza. When we log in to the console we get a set that has a size of 3. 
You might think the elements were 5 before ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone, Hashnode&#x27;s Auth0 hackathon is still ongoing. For those who have not used Auth0 before and just getting started on their hackathon projects to implement Auth0, here is a super quick step-by-step guide to set up and integrate it to a React app.
Step 1: Sign Up For An Account
Go to https://auth0.com/signup to create a free Auth0 account.

Follow the sign-up steps. You can continue with the default tenant domain name and region they set for you, or customize it yourself.

Tenant: represents the user domain that has access to the Auth0 application configurations, assets, connections, etc. The tenant domain name will be the URL used to access resources such as the Auth0 API.
Step 2: Create an Application
Now, you will be redirected to your Auth0 Dashboard. Let&#x27;s start by clicking‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>The real division and conflict are not between Liberals and Conservatives as we always hear in the media. It is between those who want a strong, central government that controls the life of its citizens on the one side and those who want a transparent, slim government and strong, self-reliant citizens on the other side.
The real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians.
George Orwell
Those two views of life are not compatible and will always conflict. You can find out what you are with The Political Compass test.

                    <span>Introduction üìö
When you go to GitHub and see some other developers code, most of them are importing their components like thisüëá
import Button from &quot;../../../components/Buttons/Button&quot;

This is called relative import. Relative import will start with either ./,/ or ../.
I am not telling that this is the wrong way and even there is no issue if you import like that, but if you have a very big and complex project, relative imports will look a lot messy similar to this. 
import Button from &quot;../../../../../../components/Buttons/Button&quot;

However, there is a very better and cleaner way to import these components. This method is called absolute import. An absolute import will look this like üëá
import Button from &quot;components/Buttons/Button&quot;

Adding absolute imports to React Apps (CRA) üí°
Open your project in any code editor and create a new file in your project&#x27;s root directory named jsconfig.json. Once you created the file paste the below JSON inside of it. 
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;baseUrl&quot;: &quot;src&quot;
  }
}

This will instruct Webpack to use the src directory as a base one.

Today, we&#x27;re going to take a look at some basic Mac Terminal/Linux commands in my experience. 
So, don&#x27;t roast me friendsüòÖ  I&#x27;m a n00b at this stuff, so I haven&#x27;t used shit like cat, grep, pbcopy or pbpaste yet.

Without further ado, let&#x27;s get fuckin started!!

1. pwd üó∫üìç 
You can use the pwd command to find out your current location in the filesystem/name of the folder currently open in your terminal window. 
The output of pwd will look something like this:

After executing the pwd command, the terminal tells us that we&#x27;re in the folder called Yuri inside of the folder Users at root.
2. ls üìù 
The ls command is used to list all the folders/files under the location specified, or if not specified, under the ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Hey Readers üëã
In this article, we‚Äôll learn about the optional chaining (?.) that simplifies the way to access values through nested objects.
What the heck is Optional chaining?  ü•¥
The optional chaining ?.  is a recent addition to the language which is a secure way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn‚Äôt exist. 
With the optional chaining if a certain property doesn&#x27;t exist then undefined is returned immediately.
The optional chaining ?. syntax has three forms:
obj?.prop ‚Äì returns obj.prop if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj?.[prop] ‚Äì returns obj[prop] if obj exists, otherwise undefined.
obj.method?.() ‚Äì calls obj.method() if obj.method exists, otherwise returns undefined
To understand the concept better let&#x27;s have a look at a few of the use cases.‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Welcome back to GraphQL for Beginners! A beginner-friendly series introducing the basic concepts of GraphQL and how to connect it to a front-end framework like React using Apollo. 
In this part, we will complete our simple chat app by building our front-end with React and Apollo Client. 
If you haven&#x27;t read the previous part, please read it here.
Step 1: Create a React App
To recap, our project folder currently has a server folder in it. Let&#x27;s create a client folder now for our React app.
In our client folder, we can create a new React app:
npx create-react-app my-app

Now, your project folder should look something like this:

Step 2: Install packages
To connect our React app to our GraphQL server, we need to install a few packages:

This guide is aimed at both designers who want to learn about accessibility considerations for designing focus indicators, as well as developers who want to implement them.
