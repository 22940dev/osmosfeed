I created a 960px canvas and set about creating a layout that I would later drop content in.

          "description": "I was a big fan of Windows OS, and have been using it for years because it is user-friendly, well-designed, and convenient. However, since I started programming I found that a Linux distro (such as Ubuntu, Manjaro, and Arch) is the best Operating System to start with.\nIn this article, I am going to share, why I most of the software engineers choose Linux over Windows for programming\nPre-installed Compilers\nThe primary reason behind the popularity of Linux is the availability of compilers or interpreter. You don't have to download them yourself. On the other hand, Windows does not come with pre-installed compilers.\nOpen Source\nUnlike Windows OS which is commercial, Linux is an open source software that is freely available to download. There are hundreds of Linux distributions available out of which almost five-hundred distro are in active development.\nCommunity Support\nAll newcomers can find help on any of the Linux forums. If you are stuck somewhere in your development process or need help in your coding process, just Google it and you can find several Linux based helpful resources.\nPerformance\nLinux is much powerful and versatile than Windows. It is light-weight OS, which makes it faster than Windows. You will notice a significant improvement in speed on a Linux distro when you start working it.\nSecure\nLinux is considered to be more secure than Windows. No antivirus is needed. Since it is open source, several developers are working on it and everyone can contribute code. It is likely that someone will find a vulnerability long before hackers can target a Linux distro. \nShell\nIf Linux does not have what you need, you can still get all the functionalities that you need from the command line. Simply enter the command and it will atomically download and install the package. Which saves a lot of efforts.",

A beginner-friendly series introducing the basic concepts of GraphQL and how to connect it to a front-end framework like React using Apollo. At the end of this series, you will be able to build a simple chat app with GraphQL, React and Apollo.\nSneak Peek:\n\nIf you haven't read Part 1, please do so here.\nSubscriptions\nIn Part 1, we learnt about the 2 operations GraphQL supports: queries and mutations. The third type is known as subscriptions. \nSubscriptions are the operation used to push data from the server to the client on a specified event. Like queries, they fetch data and return it, but only when a certain change happens. Thus, subscriptions work by having an active connection to your GraphQL server (i.e. via WebSocket), where it will listen for a …",

My first impressions, some demonstration of how it works, and my current impressions of the product.\nFirst Impression\nIt was July 8. I was excited to receive an email in the morning, that I finally got access to Copilot. I immediately went to install it in the Visual Studio Marketplace. What I first noticed when I arrived there was that Copilot had a 3-star average rating. I investigated further and was shocked to see the reason behind these mediocre reviews:\n\nMost poor (1-2 star) reviews are emotionally driven and do not contain any constructive feedback. A simple sentimental analysis shows that most bad reviews were mostly showing apprehension, concern and disagreement before even really testing the produc…",

You will create a simple Express server with an endpoint that allows you to get data from the database.\nTherefore, let's see how to set up a custom API server!\nserverMiddleware Property\nNuxt.js has a property called serverMiddleware that allows you to create additional API routes inside your application.\nHow does it work?
