I came across something I added many months ago - using the Fetch API to upload multiple files at once. The reason it's stuck in my \"todo\" pile for so long is that I wasn't aware of a good service I could use to post my files against. I've done it before in Node.js and I know it's something I could do locally in an hour, but honestly I just didn't want to. That probably sounds a bit lazy but it's honest. Today though I came across httpbin.org, an online service that lets you hit it with various types of HTTP methods and even supports file uploads. (Obviously it doesn't make those files available, it just reports back on the upload.) Even better, it supports CORS which means I could use CodePen. So with no more excuses at my disposal, today I finally built a simple demo.",

That being said, working on this did let me kick the tires a bit on a few Eleventy things and that's always a good idea.",

Runners had been attempting it since the late 19th century and were beginning to draw the conclusion that the human body simply wasn’t built for the task. \nBut on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England—conditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting—and yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes. \nThis shift in the benchmark had profound effects; the world now knew that the four-minute mile was possible.

          "description": "Introduction 📚\nWhen you go to GitHub and see some other developers code, most of them are importing their components like this👇\nimport Button from \"../../../components/Buttons/Button\"\n\nThis is called relative import. Relative import will start with either ./,/ or ../.\nI am not telling that this is the wrong way and even there is no issue if you import like that, but if you have a very big and complex project, relative imports will look a lot messy similar to this. \nimport Button from \"../../../../../../components/Buttons/Button\"\n\nHowever, there is a very better and cleaner way to import these components. This method is called absolute import. An absolute import will look this like 👇\nimport Button from \"components/Buttons/Button\"\n\nAdding absolute imports to React Apps (CRA) 💡\nOpen your project in any code editor and create a new file in your project's root directory named jsconfig.json. Once you created the file paste the below JSON inside of it. \n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis will instruct Webpack to use the src directory as a base one.\nConclusion ⌛\nI hope you found this short article helpful.

First, you will create an API from scratch, and then you will sell it on RapidAPI!\nWhat's an API?\nLet's start by refreshing our memory on what an API is. The acronym API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it's a way for two computer programs to communicate between them.\nIn simple terms, it's a piece of software offering its services to other programs through a pre-defined set of functions. The other programs do not need to know about the API implementation because the functions describe how the API can be used. You communicate with APIs through requests, and there are four types of requests…",

You can contribute to open source projects in other ways, such as:\nWriting documentation\nCreating supporting materials\nReviewing code\nTranslating to other languages\nStructure and re-structure the code and project structure\nThus, in this article, you will learn how to make your first open-source contributions with the help of Hashnode documentation.

          "description": "Hey there, JavaScript Developers👩‍💻\nIn this article we'll dig deeper into the concepts of Set and Map. \nWhat is a Set?\nA Set is a collection of unique values. That means the set can never have any duplicates and can hold any values of any data type. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order.\nOkay, this sounds interesting. So the question is how to create a set?\nTo create a set we write- new Set() and in the parentheses, we need to pass an iterable.\nconst ordersSet= new Set(['Pasta','Pizza','Coffee','Pasta','Pizza']);\n\nconsole.log(ordersSet);  // {'Pasta', 'Pizza', 'Coffee'}\n\nHere in the above example, we see some duplicate set elements like Pasta and Pizza. When we log in to the console we get a set that has a size of 3. \nYou might think the elements were 5 before …",
