          "description": "Introduction 📚\nWhen you go to GitHub and see some other developers code, most of them are importing their components like this👇\nimport Button from \"../../../components/Buttons/Button\"\n\nThis is called relative import. Relative import will start with either ./,/ or ../.\nI am not telling that this is the wrong way and even there is no issue if you import like that, but if you have a very big and complex project, relative imports will look a lot messy similar to this. \nimport Button from \"../../../../../../components/Buttons/Button\"\n\nHowever, there is a very better and cleaner way to import these components. This method is called absolute import. An absolute import will look this like 👇\nimport Button from \"components/Buttons/Button\"\n\nAdding absolute imports to React Apps (CRA) 💡\nOpen your project in any code editor and create a new file in your project's root directory named jsconfig.json. Once you created the file paste the below JSON inside of it. \n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis will instruct Webpack to use the src directory as a base one.\nConclusion ⌛\nI hope you found this short article helpful.
