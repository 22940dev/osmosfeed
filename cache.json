          "description": "I was a big fan of Windows OS, and have been using it for years because it is user-friendly, well-designed, and convenient. However, since I started programming I found that a Linux distro (such as Ubuntu, Manjaro, and Arch) is the best Operating System to start with.\nIn this article, I am going to share, why I most of the software engineers choose Linux over Windows for programming\nPre-installed Compilers\nThe primary reason behind the popularity of Linux is the availability of compilers or interpreter. You don't have to download them yourself. On the other hand, Windows does not come with pre-installed compilers.\nOpen Source\nUnlike Windows OS which is commercial, Linux is an open source software that is freely available to download. There are hundreds of Linux distributions available out of which almost five-hundred distro are in active development.\nCommunity Support\nAll newcomers can find help on any of the Linux forums. If you are stuck somewhere in your development process or need help in your coding process, just Google it and you can find several Linux based helpful resources.\nPerformance\nLinux is much powerful and versatile than Windows. It is light-weight OS, which makes it faster than Windows. You will notice a significant improvement in speed on a Linux distro when you start working it.\nSecure\nLinux is considered to be more secure than Windows. No antivirus is needed. Since it is open source, several developers are working on it and everyone can contribute code. It is likely that someone will find a vulnerability long before hackers can target a Linux distro. \nShell\nIf Linux does not have what you need, you can still get all the functionalities that you need from the command line. Simply enter the command and it will atomically download and install the package. Which saves a lot of efforts.",

They also think that contributing to open-source is all about coding.\nBut that is not true! You can contribute to open source projects in other ways, such as:\nWriting documentation\nCreating supporting materials\nReviewing code\nTranslating to other languages\nStructure and re-structure the code and project structure\nThus, in this article, you will learn how to make your first open-source contributions with the help of Hashnode documentation. Hashnode is a blogging platform that open-sourced their documentation, which is a great place to start your open-source journey.\nAbout Open Sour…",

          "description": "Did you know you can create custom API endpoints in Nuxt.js? That means you do not have to spin a standalone server. Instead, you can do it straight in your Nuxt application!\nIn this article, you will see how to do it. You will create a simple Express server with an endpoint that allows you to get data from the database.\nTherefore, let's see how to set up a custom API server!\nserverMiddleware Property\nNuxt.js has a property called serverMiddleware that allows you to create additional API routes inside your application.\nHow does it work? Nuxt.js creates an instance of connect, which is a middleware layer for Node.js. Thanks to the connect instance, you can create a custom API with different endpoints.\nThe serverMiddleware property is handy when you want to have the API in the same place as …",

But as programmers, we always strive for better ways to be more effective and productive.\nWhat is Project-Based Learning?\n-According to Robert Schuetz,\n Project-Based Learning is an instructional approach designed to allow students to develop knowledge and skills through engaging projects set around challenges and problems they may face in the real world.\nTutorials are great, but building projects is the best way to learn.
