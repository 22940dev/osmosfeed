I came across something I added many months ago - using the Fetch API to upload multiple files at once. The reason it's stuck in my \"todo\" pile for so long is that I wasn't aware of a good service I could use to post my files against. I've done it before in Node.js and I know it's something I could do locally in an hour, but honestly I just didn't want to. That probably sounds a bit lazy but it's honest. Today though I came across httpbin.org, an online service that lets you hit it with various types of HTTP methods and even supports file uploads. (Obviously it doesn't make those files available, it just reports back on the upload.) Even better, it supports CORS which means I could use CodePen. So with no more excuses at my disposal, today I finally built a simple demo.",

The intention to make our tech safer is not enough; we need a strategy.\nThis chapter will equip you with that plan of action. It covers how to integrate safety principles into your design work in order to create tech that’s safe, how to convince your stakeholders that this work is necessary, and how to respond to the critique that what we actually need is more diversity.

It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England—conditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting—and yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes. \nThis shift in the benchmark had profound effects; the world now knew that the four-minute mile was possible.

          "description": "Introduction 📚\nWhen you go to GitHub and see some other developers code, most of them are importing their components like this👇\nimport Button from \"../../../components/Buttons/Button\"\n\nThis is called relative import. Relative import will start with either ./,/ or ../.\nI am not telling that this is the wrong way and even there is no issue if you import like that, but if you have a very big and complex project, relative imports will look a lot messy similar to this. \nimport Button from \"../../../../../../components/Buttons/Button\"\n\nHowever, there is a very better and cleaner way to import these components. This method is called absolute import. An absolute import will look this like 👇\nimport Button from \"components/Buttons/Button\"\n\nAdding absolute imports to React Apps (CRA) 💡\nOpen your project in any code editor and create a new file in your project's root directory named jsconfig.json. Once you created the file paste the below JSON inside of it. \n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis will instruct Webpack to use the src directory as a base one.\nConclusion ⌛\nI hope you found this short article helpful.
