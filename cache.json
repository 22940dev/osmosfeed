I came across something I added many months ago - using the Fetch API to upload multiple files at once. The reason it's stuck in my \"todo\" pile for so long is that I wasn't aware of a good service I could use to post my files against. I've done it before in Node.js and I know it's something I could do locally in an hour, but honestly I just didn't want to. That probably sounds a bit lazy but it's honest. Today though I came across httpbin.org, an online service that lets you hit it with various types of HTTP methods and even supports file uploads. (Obviously it doesn't make those files available, it just reports back on the upload.) Even better, it supports CORS which means I could use CodePen. So with no more excuses at my disposal, today I finally built a simple demo.",

The uutils project aims to rewrite all of the individual utilities included in the GNU Coreutils project in Rust. Originally created by Jordi Boggiano in 2013, the project aims to provide drop-in replacements for the Coreutils programs, adding the data-race protection and memory safety that Rust provides.",

It features a modern command-line interface with syntax highlighting, tab completion, and auto-suggestions out of the box (all with no configuration required). Unlike many of its competitors, it doesn’t care about being POSIX-compliant but attempts to blaze its own path.\nSince our last look at the project, way back in 2013, it has seen lots of new releases with features, bug fixes, and refinements aimed at appealing to a wide range of users.",

Runners had been attempting it since the late 19th century and were beginning to draw the conclusion that the human body simply wasn’t built for the task. \nBut on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England—conditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting—and yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes. \nThis shift in the benchmark had profound effects; the world now knew that the four-minute mile was possible. Bannister’s record lasted only forty-six days, when it was snatched away by Australian ru…",

Whether to convey information, conduct transactions, or simply to check in on one another, people have yammered away, chattering and gesticulating, through spoken conversation for countless generations. Only in the last few millennia have we begun to commit our conversations to writing, and only in the last few decades have we begun to outsource them to the computer, a machine that shows much more affinity for written correspondence than for the slangy vagaries of spoken language.\nComputers have trouble because between spoken and written language, speech is more primordial. To have successful conversations with us, machines must grapple with the messiness of human speech: the disfluencies and pauses, the gestures and body language, an…",

          "description": "I was a big fan of Windows OS, and have been using it for years because it is user-friendly, well-designed, and convenient. However, since I started programming I found that a Linux distro (such as Ubuntu, Manjaro, and Arch) is the best Operating System to start with.\nIn this article, I am going to share, why I most of the software engineers choose Linux over Windows for programming\nPre-installed Compilers\nThe primary reason behind the popularity of Linux is the availability of compilers or interpreter. You don't have to download them yourself. On the other hand, Windows does not come with pre-installed compilers.\nOpen Source\nUnlike Windows OS which is commercial, Linux is an open source software that is freely available to download. There are hundreds of Linux distributions available out of which almost five-hundred distro are in active development.\nCommunity Support\nAll newcomers can find help on any of the Linux forums. If you are stuck somewhere in your development process or need help in your coding process, just Google it and you can find several Linux based helpful resources.\nPerformance\nLinux is much powerful and versatile than Windows. It is light-weight OS, which makes it faster than Windows. You will notice a significant improvement in speed on a Linux distro when you start working it.\nSecure\nLinux is considered to be more secure than Windows. No antivirus is needed. Since it is open source, several developers are working on it and everyone can contribute code. It is likely that someone will find a vulnerability long before hackers can target a Linux distro. \nShell\nIf Linux does not have what you need, you can still get all the functionalities that you need from the command line. Simply enter the command and it will atomically download and install the package. Which saves a lot of efforts.",

Building and selling APIs is a great way to create a new source of passive income.\nThus, in this article, you will see how to do that! First, you will create an API from scratch, and then you will sell it on RapidAPI!\nWhat's an API?\nLet's start by refreshing our memory on what an API is. The acronym API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it's a way for two computer programs to communicate between them.\nIn simple terms, it's a piece of software offering its services to other programs through a pre-defined set of functions. The other programs do not need to know about the API implementation because the functions describe how the API can be used.
