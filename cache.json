A search form, basically.\nThe idea is to create a semantic HTML element for the ARIA search role, which represents a landmark region “that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a search facility.”\nOpinions have been shared in the Twitter thread about whether adding a new HTML element is necessary.

His foldable bike next to the bench, a binocular in his hands, he was watching birds.\nThe weeks went by and I saw him again and again. Our encounters started with a nod, then a short greeting, each time I passed by the bench. And one day he lifted his hand, signalizing me he would like to say something.

I wrote a modern interpretation of the poem a few month ago.\nAnd then I started learning the poem. First for fun, and I wasn’t sure I would be able to remember it, because it’s long (10 stanzas with four lines).

It covers how to integrate safety principles into your design work in order to create tech that’s safe, how to convince your stakeholders that this work is necessary, and how to respond to the critique that what we actually need is more diversity.
