In official terms, Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that runs on Chrome's V8 engine. Still a bit complicated? In simpler terms, Node.js allows developers to run JavaScript on the Back-end. That is, you can build web servers with JavaScript.\nBefore Node.js, you could only run JavaScript in the browser, and it was used to make websites interactive. But you could not run JavaScript in other places; it was only on the client-side.\nWhen Node.js was released in 2009, it changed that! It allowed developers to write JavaScript applications and run them natively on their machines for the first time.\nWhat makes Node.js so great?\nS‚Ä¶",
